<h2 class="intro">Preface</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span></p>

<p>This volume contains a life of Mazzini and a study of
his thought. It can hardly be said that any serious
attempt has been made either in England or Italy to
deal with either. Hence the present volume, however
unequal to the subject, may have its use. The thirty
years, which have passed since Mazzini's death, make
it possible now to place him in his true perspective;
and the author trusts that the supreme admiration,
which he feels for Mazzini as a man, has not prevented
him from viewing the politician with impartiality.
There exists abundant matter to allow us to
judge Mazzini's political work, and it is unlikely that
anything yet to be published will seriously affect our
estimate of it. For the personal side of Mazzini's life,
the moment is not a very opportune one. Ten years
ago it would have been possible to glean reminiscences
from many, who are now silent. It has been the
author's privilege, however, to obtain invaluable information
from two of the very few persons now living,
who knew Mazzini intimately. While it is nearly too
late for personal reminiscences, it is too early to avail
oneself fully of Mazzini's correspondence. A good
many of his letters have indeed been published, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
have been able to use a good many unpublished ones,
especially his correspondence with Mr and Mrs Peter
Taylor, which I have found of the greatest value. But
unfortunately only one volume has as yet appeared of
the collected edition of his correspondence, and there
are still probably many of his letters, which have yet
to come to light in Italy.</p>

<p>With regard to the study, which occupies the second
part of this volume, the author is very sensible of his
limitations in dealing with so vast and complex a
system as Mazzini's ethical and political thought. It
is his hope that he may do something to stimulate
more competent writers to labour in a very fruitful
field. He believes that the more Mazzini's thought is
disentangled, the more its essential importance will
appear.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge gratefully the kindness of
those who have helped me in writing this book. Above
all I am indebted to Mr and Mrs W. T. Malleson, to
whom I owe the loan of the Peter Taylor correspondence
and other invaluable help; to Miss Shaen for
letting me see Mazzini's letters to her father, Mr W.
Shaen, and the MS. of the "Prayer for the Planters,"
now first published; to Mr Milner-Gibson Cullum,
Miss Dorothea Hickson, Mr Mazzini Stuart, Mr P. S.
King, and Miss Galeer for the loan of unpublished
letters from Mazzini. I have also to acknowledge my
grateful thanks to many others, who have assisted me,
among whom I would especially mention Miss Ashurst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
Biggs, Signor Mario Borsa, Mr James Bryce, M.P.,
Mr W. Burnley, Signora Giuditta Casali-Benvenuti (to
whom I owe the portrait of her grandmother, Giuditta
Sidoli), Mr T. Chambers, Signor Felice Dagnino, Signor
G. Gallavresi, Mrs Goodwin, Miss Edith Harvey, Mr
H. M. Hyndman, Dr Courtney Kenny, Miss Lucy
Martineau, Professor Masson, Mr C. E. Maurice,
Mademoiselle Dora Melegari, Mr D. Nathan, Mr T.
Okey, Mr Chas. Roberts, Mr J. J. Stansfeld, the Società
Editrice Sonzogno (for permission to reproduce some
illustrations from Madame White Mario's life of Mazzini),
Mr W. R. Thayer, and Mr Remsen Whitehouse.</p>

<p class="p2">A reissue of the book has allowed me to revise it in
the light of recent publications referring to Mazzini.
A good many more of his letters have been printed
since 1902 (including a second volume of the <i>Epistolario</i>),
but with the exception of Mademoiselle
Melegari's collection of his letters to her father, they
are not important. Nor, with the exception of Signor
Cantimori's illuminating <i>Saggio</i>, have I found any
useful recent studies of his thought. I still adhere to
the view that subsequent research will add little to our
knowledge of him. I am glad, however, to be able
now to take a different view of his connection with
the publication of Kossuth's manifesto in 1853, and
of Madame Sidoli's mission to Florence in 1833 (see
pp. <a href="#Page_68">68</a> and <a href="#Page_169">169</a>).</p>

Boyhood and Youth&mdash;University Life&mdash;Literary Studies&mdash;Classicism
and Romanticism&mdash;Joins the Carbonari&mdash;Arrest and Exile.</p>

<p>Joseph Mazzini was born in the Via Lomellina at
Genoa on June 22, 1805. His father was a doctor
of some repute and Professor of Anatomy at the
University, a democrat in creed and life, who gave
much of his time to unpaid service of the poor; at
home affectionate and loved, though sometimes hard
and imperious. His mother, to whom in after life
he bore a strong resemblance, was a capable and
devoted woman, who had little of the weakness of an
Italian mother, and brought up her children to bear
the brunt of life; with strong interest in the mighty
movements that were remoulding Europe at the time,
a mordant critic of governors and governments inside
the four walls of her house. It was a happy home,
and "Pippo" grew up the darling of his parents and
three sisters, a delicate, sensitive, gentle child, quick
and insistent to learn despite his father's fears for his
health, and giving precocious proof of brilliant talents.
He was nearly nine years old, when the Napoleonic
system was shattered, and the Emperor went to Elba.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Doubtless, Mazzini heard from his father that Napoleon
was Italian born and was going to exile in an Italian
island. The shock of the downfall was felt at Genoa,
for the proud city, to which Lord William Bentinck
had promised in the name of England its ancient
independence, learnt that "republics were no longer
fashionable," and saw itself helplessly made over to
the alien rule of Piedmont. Bitterly the Genoese
chafed at the traffic of their liberties, and we may be
sure that there was republican talk in Mazzini's home,
which sank into the mind of the thoughtful child.
He himself mentions four influences that turned his
boyish mind to democracy: his parents' uniform
courtesy to every rank of life; the reminiscences of
the French republican wars in the talk at home;
some numbers of an old Girondist paper, which his
father kept half hidden, for fear of the police, behind his
medical books; and&mdash;more than all these, probably&mdash;the
classics that he read under his Latin tutor. "The
history of Greece and Rome," wrote a fellow-student,
"the only thing taught us with any care at school,
was little else than a constant libel upon monarchy,
and a panegyric upon the democratic form of government."
Like many another boy of his time who had
for school exercises to declaim the praises of Cato and
the Bruti, he came to regard republics as the appointed
homes of virtue. It was the unintended fruit of the
classical training, which the despotic governments of
the time fostered to keep their youth innocent of any
itch for innovation.</p>

<p>So he lived his quiet, studious home-life, till an
incident one day, when he was nearly sixteen, suddenly
changed its tenor. The Carbonaro revolutions of 1820
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
and 1821 had ended in deserved collapse; and the
Piedmontese Liberals, abandoned and defeated, crowded
to Genoa and Sampierdarena, while yet there was time
to escape to Spain. Some had fled penniless, and
Mazzini, walking with his mother, noted their despairing
faces, and watched while a collection was made
for them in the streets. Their memory haunted him,
and with a boy's enthusiasm for his heroes, he longed
to follow them. He neglected his lessons, and sat
moody and absorbed, interested only in gleaning news
of the exiles and learning the history of their defeat.
In his boyish impatience, which came near the truth,
he felt "they might have won, if all had done their
duty," and the thought puzzled and obsessed him.
He insisted on dressing in black, and kept the habit
to the end of life. He brooded over Foscolo's <i>Jacopo
Ortis</i>, till the morbid pessimism of the book wrought
on him, and his mother, apparently with good reason,
feared suicide.</p>

<p>In time he recovered his balance, and went back to
his books with the old zest. He was now studying
medicine, intending to follow his father's profession;
but at his first attendance in the operation room he
fainted, and it was clear that he could never be a
surgeon.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To his father it must have been a sore
disappointment, but he seems to have at once recognised
the inevitable, and allowed the lad to read law.
Mazzini had little heart in his new studies, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
arid, perfunctory teaching of law current at the time had
small attraction for one who wanted to know the reason
of things; but he persevered, and did well in his examinations,
though it is probable that he always gave
a big slice of his time to reading poetry and history.
He was now at the University. Probably he went
to school, though there is some doubt about it; at all
events he seems to have escaped the brutality and
bad pedagogy, which generally made school life then
one long misery for a high-principled or sensitive lad.
University life began at an early age in Italy, and
Mazzini had matriculated at Genoa, when he was fourteen.
So far as his fellow-students were concerned, he
was in happy surroundings. But he was a troublesome
scholar, always ready to rebel against the formalities
that made a big part of University life. To the last he
refused to attend the compulsory religious observances,
not because he disliked them, but because they were
compulsory; and the authorities, tolerant for once,
shut their eyes to his insubordination. The University
of Genoa did not possess a high name for scholarship;
and at this time it had its special drawbacks, for the
government was scared by the recent revolution, and
fearful that a few hundred lads might shake the pillars
of the state. No one could matriculate without a
certificate that he had regularly attended church and
confession. Those whose parents did not possess a
certain quantity of landed property, had to pass a
stiffer examination, though at the worst, it is probable,
not a very prohibitive one. Lecturers, beadles, porters,
all had the cue from government to make life unpleasant
for the students, and the better professors
dared not be detected in any leniency or considerateness.
Moustaches were forbidden, as a mark of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
revolutionary mind, and if any student, greatly daring,
grew them, he was carried off between two carabineers
to a barber's shop.</p>

</div>
<p>Mazzini soon became a leader among the clean-living,
affectionate, impetuous undergraduates. His
appearance was now, as always, very striking; he had
a high and prominent forehead, black, flashing eyes,
fine olive features, set in a mass of thick black hair,
a grave, serious face, that could look hard at times,
but readily melted in the kindliest of smiles. He led
a studious, retiring life, fond of gymnastics and fencing,
but with small taste for amusements, his cigars and
coffee his only indulgences; his days spent among his
books, his evenings with his mother, or in long solitary
walks that defied the weather, or in rare and stolen
visits to the theatre, which he had to leave after the
first act, for the home was rigorously shut at ten.
But, though he was slow to make close friendships, he
was no misanthrope. He played much on the guitar
and sang well to it; and his musical talents and clever
reciting made him in demand among his middle-class
and patrician friends. There was none yet of the half-bitter
sadness of after life; he had a shrewd sense of
humour, perhaps inherited from his mother; when
warmed by enthusiasm or indignation, he could speak
with a fiery eloquence, that was remarkable even among
those declamatory Italian youths. "My soul," he
wrote afterwards, "was then a smile for all created
things, life showed to my virgin fancy as a dream of
love, my warmest thoughts were for nature's loveliness
and the ideal woman of my youth." He revelled in
generous actions, sharing books and money, even
clothes, with his poorer friends. But it was sheer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
force of character that gave him his ascendancy over
them&mdash;the loyal, justice-loving nature that made him
champion of every victim of undergraduate or professorial
spite, the purity of thought, that checked
each loose or coarse word from those about him.
That clear, high soul, untouched by self, not knowing
fear, passionate for righteousness, gave him even when
a lad the power that belongs only to the saints of God.</p>

<p>His closest friends were three brothers, Jacopo,
Giovanni, and Agostino Ruffini. Jacopo, the eldest
of the three, had perhaps more influence on Mazzini's
life than any other man. They were born on the same
day; and Jacopo's fine, sensitive, enthusiastic nature
matched well with Mazzini's own. The tragic fate,
that afterwards brought his life to an early close, only
strengthened the influence; and the memory of one so
dear, who gave his life for their common cause, remained
a perennial inspiration to keep his faith alive in years of
weariness and failure. The other brothers had little
of Jacopo's temperament. Giovanni at this time was
an even-tempered, humourous, brilliant lad; Agostino
was impressionable, impulsive, shallow, of quick and
artistic nature. Mazzini's closest companions for some
years, they proved how little they could rise to his
high level, and they repaid his devotion by a want
of sympathy and an ingratitude, which, in Agostino's
case at all events, was gross. In later life both
attained in their small way; both were deputies in the
Piedmontese parliament, and Giovanni was minister at
Paris. They long moved in English society and had
some reputation there. Agostino, who was for a time
a teacher at Edinburgh, is the "Signor Sperano" who
tells the story of <i>The Poor Clare</i>, in Mrs Gaskell's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<i>Round the Sofa</i>. Giovanni, who became as proficient
in English as in his mother tongue, wrote two notable
but now half-forgotten tales, <i>Lorenzo Benoni</i> and <i>Doctor
Antonio</i>, which stand among the best second-rate novels
of his time.</p>

<p>Under Mazzini's lead the group of friends at Genoa
formed a society to study literature and politics and
smuggle in forbidden books. Half the masterpieces
of contemporary European literature came at this
time under the censor's ban; no foreign papers were
admitted except two ultra-monarchical French journals;
and contraband was a necessity of literary study.
Mazzini's strongest interests took him to literature.
He read omnivorously in Italian and French and
English and translations from the German.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His
favourite books, he tells us, were the Bible and Dante,
Shakespeare and Byron. His close knowledge of the
Gospels comes out in everything he wrote. He shed
his orthodoxy indeed as soon as he began to think;
he went sometimes to mass, when a lad, and read
Condorcet's <i>Esquisse</i> disguised as a missal; but he
refused to go to confession as soon as he understood
its meaning,&mdash;the one thing, apparently, in all his life
which pained his mother. For a short time he went
through a phase of scepticism, but the Ruffinis' mother
soon rescued him from this, and a deep religious faith
came to him, to remain the spring of all his life. The
poets he loved best were Dante and Byron, and he
always remained true to them. From Dante he learnt
many of the master-ideas of his mind, the conception
of the unity of man and unity of law, the fervid patriotism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the belief in Italy and Rome predestined to be
teachers of the world, the faith in Italian Unity, the
moral strength that makes life one long fight for good.
When only some twenty years old, he wrote an essay
on Dante's patriotism, which, however boyish in style,
proves his close knowledge of the master. Byron was
then at the height of his fame, and then, as always
afterwards, Mazzini thought him the greatest of
modern English, perhaps of modern European poets.
He was "completely fascinated" by Goethe, and
would often say that "to pass a day with him or a
genius like him would be the fairest day of life."
How his admiration for Goethe waned, while that for
Byron grew, will be told in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He
read Shakespeare, but always, apparently, with more
respect than enjoyment, and Shakespeare too came
under the same ban as Goethe. He thought very
highly of Schiller, and placed him with Æschylus and
Shakespeare, as the third great dramatist of the world.
He read a good deal of English literature; at this
time he was a fervent admirer of Scott, but he seems
afterwards to have lost his interest in him; he knew
something at least of Wordsworth and Shelley, Burns
and Crabbe. Modern French literature, except de
Vigny's and some of Victor Hugo's writings, did not
now (nor, with the exception of George Sand and
Lamennais, at any time), appeal to him, for he disliked
the tendencies of French Romanticism, and
already there were the beginnings of his life-long prejudice
against most things French. Among his modern
fellow-countrymen Alfieri and Foscolo were his
favourites; he read Manzoni and Guerrazzi, but largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to criticise them, though he was ready to do justice to
the strength of both. He thought Mickiewicz, the
Polish national poet, "the most powerful poetic nature
of the time." The classics he no doubt read pretty
widely, as every educated lad was then bound to do,
but none seem to have made much impression on him,
except Æschylus, for whom his veneration was unbounded,
and Tacitus. Both now and later he gave
much time to metaphysical and political writers. He
read something of Hegel, whom he detested for his
political fatalism, of Kant and Fichte; but the German
who influenced him most was the now-forgotten
Herder. From him he learned or confirmed his
spiritual conception of life, his belief in immortality,
his theory of the progress of humanity and man's
co-operation in the work of Providence. Among
Italian philosophers he studied Giordano Bruno and
Vico; he rated the latter at his real worth, and
regarded him as the great luminary of an Italian
school of thought whose continuity he professed to
trace from Pythagoras. Among political writers
Macchiavelli certainly impressed him most, as a great
Italian patriot, and he excused his morality as a
product of his time. He seems to have known a
good deal of Voltaire and Rousseau. Of recent
political writers, he and his circle most read Guizot
and Victor Cousin, whose lectures at this time made
them the mentors of young liberalism; he records
how the group at Genoa handed on to one another
manuscript copies of the lectures, and found their
inspiration in the men whom they were soon to regard
as traitors.</p>

<p>Now and for long after, literature was the call that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
spoke sweetest to Mazzini. Politics and conspiracy
were constraining but unwelcomed duties; he gave
his love to literature. To be a dramatist or write
historical novels was at this time his plan of life.
Many a time in later years he was still looking for
the day, when Italy would be united and free, and,
his political task accomplished, he could give himself
to the literary schemes he still cherished,&mdash;a history
of religious ideas, a popular history of Italy, and the
editing of a series of the great dramas of the world.
But the burden of his country's woe lay too heavily
on him to be long forgotten. It was no time now
for Dante studies or play-writing. Sadly and unwillingly
he convinced himself that at such a time
pure literature was no patriot's first task, that the
writer, who would not shirk his duty, must make his
work political. Not but what the literary critic still
appears on every page; but the whole gist of his
teaching is that the value of a book is in proportion
to its power to inform the reader's soul to love of
country and mankind, and impel him to serve his
fellows by political action in the sight of God. He
held it wasted effort to do, what Manzoni had tried
to do,&mdash;to school the individual to a smug life of
cloistered virtue, a life which in a vicious or torpid
society was impossible to the many. No religion, no
morality, he taught, is worth the writer's labours, unless
it dedicates men to be workers in the public cause,
to hold comfort, and, if need be, home and life itself
as cheap, while oppression and wrong are stunting
other lives, and men and women round are crying to
be freed.</p>

<p>He found his opportunity in the controversy between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Romanticists and Classicists, which then divided
the literary world of Italy into hot factions. Not that
he held Romanticism to be any final or faultless form
of literature. But when a theory of literary servitude,
like Classicism, lent itself to political oppression and
depressed the vital and spiritual forces of the country,
when a young and vigorous movement was making
literature free and stood for liberty all round, he
necessarily took his stand for the latter. There
could be no political or social regeneration for Italy,
till she had a literature that made for freedom and
progress. "These literary disputes," he urged, "are
bound up with all that is important in social and
civil life"; "the legislation and literature of a people
always advance on parallel lines," and "the progress
of intellectual culture stands in intimate relationship
with the political life of the country." It was the
aim of the Romanticists "to give Italians an original
national literature, not one that is as a sound of
passing music to tickle the ear and die, but one that
will interpret to them their aspirations, their ideas,
their needs, their social movement." And thus, while
generously recognising Manzoni's worth, he looked
rather to Alfieri and Foscolo, who had scourged
political wrong-doing and preached resistance to
tyranny; he praised the writers of the <i>Conciliatore</i>,
the short-lived Milanese journal of Silvio Pellico
and Confalonieri, which, like himself, had turned
Romanticism to political purposes. Here and there
in his writings of this time a more or less direct
political allusion manages to escape the censor's eye.
He speaks for the first time of "Young Italy," a name
soon to ring through Europe; he pays his tribute to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the political exiles; he slips in a remark that the
spirit of a state cannot be changed without recasting
its institutions. More than this he could not do in a
censor-ridden press; perhaps literature was struggling
still with politics to command his mind.</p>

<p>As it was, he had trouble enough with the censors.
His first published articles appeared in the <i>Indicatore
Genovese</i>, a commercial paper issuing at Genoa, whose
editor was persuaded to admit short notices of recent
books, which gradually swelled into literary essays.
Among his later contributions were an article
on the historical novel and reviews of Friedrich
Schlegel's History of Literature and Guerrazzi's Battle
of Benevento. They do not read very well. They
are juvenile and exaggerated, and it is amusing
to find the twenty-three years' old author telling his
coeval Guerrazzi, the young Leghorn novelist, that he
had not drunk enough of the cup of life to be a pessimist.
The <i>Indicatore</i> gradually became a literary
paper, and for a few months the censorship did not
see what it was tending to. At the end of 1828,
however, about a year after Mazzini began to write in
it, it was suppressed. Mazzini easily transferred his
energies. Guerrazzi had founded another paper at
Leghorn much on the same lines, the <i>Indicatore
Livornese</i>, and asked Mazzini to send contributions.
Mazzini readily responded; he wrote, besides minor
papers, an article on Faust, and attacked the defects
of the Romanticist School in an essay on <i>Some
Tendencies of European Literature</i>. His writing is
still effusive, and generally dogmatic and sententious,
but the style has improved. The censorship was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
comparatively lenient in Tuscany, and though the
young writers were barred from direct reference to
politics, they were able to make the political allusions
sufficiently transparent. But the paper grew too
daring even for the somnolent Tuscan censors, and,
like its predecessor, it was snuffed out after a year of
life. Mazzini and Guerrazzi parted, to go on very
different ways, and meet again nineteen years later
when both were famous.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mazzini had with some difficulty
got a footing on the <i>Antologia</i>, the one Italian review
of the time that ranked among the great European
periodicals. It had been founded some ten years
before, in the hope that it might become an Italian
Edinburgh Review, by Gino Capponi, the blind Florentine
noble who traced his race from the Capponi who
bearded Charles VIII., and Vieusseux, a Swiss bookseller
who had settled at Florence and opened the one
circulating library of any note in Italy. Most of the
leading Italian writers of the day contributed to it;
and though its aim was avowedly nationalist, and in a
sense Liberal, it had succeeded so far, thanks probably
to its influential patrons, in eluding the censor's ban.
Mazzini wrote for it three articles <i>On the Historical
Drama</i> and another <i>On a European Literature</i>. His
work had rapidly matured, and there is no trace now
of the juvenilities of his earlier efforts. Every page
has the mark of the strong, original thought, which
made him one of the greatest critics of the century.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was practising at the bar in a
desultory fashion. Sometimes he pleaded in the
lower courts as an "advocate of the poor," and was
much in demand for his attention and skill. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to the etiquette of the profession, he read in the
rooms of a barrister, who limited his interest to seeing
that his pupils sat with a book in front of them. The
vacations were generally spent in a little country villa
at San Secondo, in the Bisagno valley, within sight
of a house which the Ruffinis occupied; and he
shared in attentions to the Ruffinis' mother, who was
now his spiritual guide and dearest friend, or went
on botanical walks or shooting expeditions in the
lovely hill country. He did not do much of the
shooting himself, and when he was more than fifty,
he remembered with remorse a thrush that he had
mangled when sixteen.</p>

<p>His interests became more and more absorbed by
politics. His Genoese home no doubt encouraged
this, for the nobles and the working-classes were still
unreconciled to Piedmontese rule, while the liberals of
the middle classes looked on the annexation only as
a step to some wider Italian state. But the local
environment was only a minor influence, and Mazzini
would doubtless have become a conspirator, had he
lived in any other town of Italy. About the time
that he began to write in the <i>Indicatore Genovese</i>, he
was admitted into the Society of the Carbonari. The
Carbonari were at this time suffering from the decadence,
which sooner or later palsies every secret society.
They had grown out of Neapolitan Freemasonry in
the days of the French rule, and when, after Napoleon's
fall, reaction came and the old dynasties returned, they
swept into their ranks the mass of discontented men,
who, with very varying political ideals, were at one
in resenting the small tyrannies, the bigotry and
obscurantism of the princes, who had come back from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
exile to misgovern and sometimes to oppress. The
high level of their tenets, their appeals to religion
and morality, the esoteric symbolism of their rites, the
vague democratic sentiment that was often only skin-deep,
had made them a vast Liberal organisation.
Since they had made and wrecked the revolutions of
Naples and Piedmont seven years before, they had
kept the skeleton of their party together with considerable
skill and persistency. But the conspiracy
had changed its character. It was no longer a purely
Italian society, for the exiles had carried it into France
and Spain, and the headquarters were now at Paris,
where Lafayette and the Orleanist conspirators were
using it to upset the Legitimist monarchy and dreamed
of a league of Latin countries to balance the Holy
Alliance. In Italy the democratic sentimentalism
had left it, it had lost touch with the masses, and
its leaders were mostly middle-aged men of the professional
classes, who discouraged young recruits,
and had no wish to step outside their meaningless
small formalisms and barren talk of liberty.</p>

<p>Mazzini had little stomach for their ritualism and
lack of purpose, their love of royal and noble leaders;
and probably the subordinate position, that as a young
man he necessarily took, sat uncomfortably on him.
But at all events they were the only revolutionary
organisation in the country, and he admired the
bravery of men, who risked prison or exile for however
inadequate an end. Though fitfully in practice,
he had a theoretic belief in subordination, which
prepared him for the moment to act under orders.
But as soon as he joined the Carbonari and swore
the usual oath of initiation over a bared dagger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
he began to see the futility of it all. He found
that he was sworn only to obey his unknown
chiefs, and he was allowed to know the names of
two or three only of his fellow-conspirators. He
suspected that their political programme, if they had
any, was but a thin one. All the Italian in him
revolted against men, who talked lightly of their
country, and preached that salvation could only come
from France. The subscription to the Society's funds,
of which, needless to say, no account was rendered,
was sufficiently heavy to bear hardly on his slender
purse. He was so sickened by a melodramatic
announcement, perhaps in bluff, that a member was
to be assassinated for criticising the chiefs, that he
threatened to withdraw. His unknown superiors,
however, apparently thought well of him, and he
was commissioned to go on propagandist work to
Tuscany, where he made a few recruits. He seems
to have returned in better spirits as to the future of
the Society; and if we may believe Giovanni Ruffini,
he began with a few young co-affiliates to organise
on his own account, nominally in the name of the
Carbonari, but really to substitute a more vigorous
association. His plan was apparently to bring the
Carbonari of Tuscany and Bologna into closer touch
with those of Genoa and Piedmont. He asked for
a passport for Bologna on the pretext that he wanted
to examine a Dante manuscript, but was told by the
police, that if he had no more important business, he
could wait. Baffled in this, he returned to his semi-independent
conspiracy at home. The July Revolution
in France had raised the hopes of liberals everywhere;
and he and his friends enrolled affiliates, discarding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the Carbonaro lumber of oaths and secret signs, and
simply pledging them to act, if an insurrection proved
possible. Bullets were cast, and other juvenile preparations
made. How far he succeeded in enlisting
followers, we do not know, for he himself has left
hardly any record of the plan.</p>

<p>At all events, it was abruptly nipped. The
government had its secret agents among the Carbonari,
and Mazzini was arrested on the charge of
initiating one of them. It is probable that the
authorities had suspected him for some time. He
was, as the governor of Genoa told his father, "gifted
with some talent, and too fond of walking by himself
at night absorbed in thought. What on earth," asked
the offended officer, "has he at his age to think about?
We don't like young people thinking without our
knowing the subject of their thoughts." Mazzini was
taken to the fortress of Savona, where he consoled
himself by watching the sea and sky, which made all
the prospect from his cell windows, and taming a
serin finch, which would fly in through the gratings,
and to which he "became exceedingly attached." His
case came before the Senate of Turin, the highest
court in the country. In the eyes of the law he was
supremely guilty; but, with an adroitness that he
afterwards recalled with pride, he managed to destroy
all compromising papers, and there was only one
witness of the initiation, whereas the law required
two. Mazzini stoutly denied the fact. The denial
was more than a plea of not guilty in an English
court; perhaps he thought that a conspirator is
bound to put his government outside the pale of
moral obligation. But whatever we may allow for

his position, the plain man will count his action as
one of the disingenuous lapses, that rarely, now and
again, stain the clear honour of his life.</p>

<p>The court had to acquit him, but the authorities
had too much evidence of his activity to leave him
unmolested. They gave him the choice between
internment in a small town or exile. Contemporary
events decided him. The revolution had just broken
out in Central Italy; the French government had
encouraged the Carbonari to expect direct or indirect
assistance, and Mazzini thought that he would serve
the cause best at Paris, whence, he confidently hoped,
he would soon return to a liberated Italy. In
February 1831 he said his good-byes to his family,
who had hastened to Savona, and crossed the
Apennines and, for the first time, the Alps, afterwards
so familiar and beloved. He watched the
sunrise from Mont Cenis, and has left a memorable
description of it, drawn with all the wealth of his
artistic imagery. At Geneva he made the acquaintance
of Sismondi and his Scotch wife. While there,
he was advised to join the Italian exiles at Lyons,
and, giving up the projected journey to Paris, he made
his way to them.</p>

Condition of Italy&mdash;The Revolution of 1831&mdash;Young Italy&mdash;Its principles:
belief in Italy; inspiration of duty; social reform&mdash;Its political
system: Republicanism; Italian Unity; war with Austria&mdash;Secret
societies.</p>

<p>The governor of the prison at Savona had allowed
him to read the Bible, Byron, and Tacitus, innocently
thinking that they contained no revolutionary material.
Out of these and Dante sprang Young Italy. Italy
was ripe for the teaching of the epoch-making society.
The country was "a geographical expression." Conquerors,
whose appetites had been tempted by the
Southern land, had carved it into appanages for
themselves. Austria held Lombardy and the lands
of the Venetian republic; the King of Piedmont
ruled the North-West, and Sardinia, and Savoy across
the Alps; the Bourbons of Naples had the South;
the Pope, the grand-duke of Tuscany, the petty dukes
of Modena, Parma, and Lucca divided up the Centre.
Nor had there been any serious demand for unity.
History and character sundered North and South;
the great medieval cities still cherished their independence
too dearly to wish to sink it in a common
country. Napoleon, while he ruled, had gone far to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
unite the land both in form and substance; and the
aspirations he did so much to create survived him.
Weak though they still were, practical grievances were
ever enforcing the argument for unity; and Italians
were chafing more and more against the artificial
barriers, which stopped the circulation of the nation's
life. The customs-lines, that met the trader on the
confines of each state, strangled commerce. Literature
circulated with difficulty, and the Genoese could hardly
get access to books published at Florence or Leghorn,
a hundred miles away. In the smaller states at all
events, the area was too small to offer any field for
enterprise, and every lawyer and engineer and civil
servant was cribbed by the restrictions, that confined
his activities to a handful of towns. Through all the
peninsula there was a more or less intolerable misrule.
Political disabilities allowed no voice in legislation, no
control of taxation or the executive, no rights of public
meeting or association, small liberty of speech or
writing. There were more present grievances in the
discouragement of education, in the clerical tyranny,
in the obsolete and partial legal system. And the
misgovernment had its yet more evil and intimate
aspect in the power of the police, which threatened
each man's home and honour and career. Governments,
that breathed and moved in chronic dread of
revolution, sought safety in a system of covert terrorism.
The police had their spies everywhere,&mdash;in the streets,
in men's households, in the churches, in the universities,&mdash;to
scrape up any idle word or act, that seemed to
mark a possible critic of government. There were
mitigations of the misrule in Piedmont, Tuscany, and
the Austrian territories. But in the Pope's states and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Naples there was little or nothing to relieve the crying
corruption and incompetency; and everywhere there
was more or less a vexatious intolerance and oppression,
that showed the blacker after the relative liberty
and progress of Napoleon's rule.</p>

<p>The Carbonari had voiced somewhat fitfully the
national protest. And just at this time they made
their final attempt at revolution. Early in February
1831,&mdash;just before Mazzini was released from Savona,&mdash;the
insurrection broke out in Modena, and
spread at once to Parma and the Papal province of
Romagna. In three weeks the greater part of the
Pope's dominions were free, and the insurgent army
was marching towards Rome. The leaders knew that,
however easy it was to upset the rule of the Pope and
Dukes, they could make no effective resistance to an
Austrian attack; but they counted on the promised
backing of France to ward off invasion. "Non-intervention,"&mdash;the
European equivalent of the Monroe
Doctrine,&mdash;was one of the formulas of the July
Monarchy, and by it Austria had no right to interfere
in the domestic concerns of an Italian state. The
French government had assured the Carbonari, that,
if she violated the principle, it would declare war
against her. But only a section of the ministry was
sincere in the promise, and Louis Philippe saw that a
war in the name of nationality might easily slide into
a revolutionary movement, which would shake his own
unsure throne. His government let Metternich know
that non-intervention was a phrase that stopped at
words. By the end of March, despite some fine
fighting by the Italian levies, the Austrians had
stamped out the ephemeral insurrection. Its feebleness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
courted failure. Not that the programme of the
leaders wanted breadth and boldness. Mazzini's after
criticism that it was neither nationalist nor democratic
was exaggerated and unjust. During their few weeks
of rule, the chiefs had showered projects of social
reform. Some of them at all events wished to make
Romagna the centre of a great national rising, and
aimed at an independent federation of all Italy with
Rome for its capital. But they made two irreparable
mistakes. They did not face the facts; they failed
to win the people. They were for the most part, like
the rest of the Carbonaro leaders, middle-aged professional
men, out of touch with the masses, possessed
by the dread that popular imprudences might scare
the diplomatists, on whom they built their hopes.
Under an inspiring chief, the people would have
fought perhaps, as they fought seventeen years later,
when they drove the Austrians in confusion from
Bologna. But the leaders were not the men to touch
their enthusiasm. They had, in fact, miscalculated
what the movement meant. These comfortable men
of peace flinched from the fact that Austria must be
fought and beaten. They had no stuff for a desperate
guerilla fight, that meant the wasting of the country,
privation and disease and death, for an uncertain hope
that France might come eventually to the rescue.
Still less were they prepared to launch on a forlorn
enterprise, where friends were none and immediate
disaster certain, that they might be precursors of their
children's victories.</p>

<p>Their failure, so consonant with all the later
Carbonaro policy, confirmed Mazzini in his belief
that a new organisation was needed and new men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to lead it. As usual, he saw only one set of facts.
He exaggerated the mistakes of the revolutionary
governments, and left out of his reckoning the
unreadiness of the people. The insurrections had
failed, he convinced himself, simply because they
had been badly led. In the main, indeed, he was
right. The revolution had been in the wrong hands.
The Carbonaro chiefs kept at arm's-length younger
men, whose energy might have made up for their
own unforwardness. If the next revolution was to
fare better, it must have these younger men to
captain it, men of confidence and enthusiasm and
fresh ideas, men with a message that would nerve
"those artisans of insurrection, the people and the
young." Mazzini had at this time a supreme faith
in his generation; he had already written in the
<i>Antologia</i> of "this young Italy of ours," so vigorous
and cultured and warm-hearted, that no new movement,
however bold and difficult, was beyond its powers.
"Place," he said now, "the young at the head of
the insurgent masses; you do not know what
strength is latent in those young bands, what magic
influence the voice of the young has on the crowd;
you will find in them a host of apostles for the new
religion. But youth lives on movement, grows great
in enthusiasm and faith. Consecrate them with a
lofty mission; inflame them with emulation and
praise; spread through their ranks the word of fire,
the word of inspiration; speak to them of country,
of glory, of power, of great memories." They
had been muzzled in the past; they must not be
again. So rigidly did he insist on this, that the
rules of Young Italy excluded from membership,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
except in special cases, all who were over forty years.
Mazzini had no diffidence to curb the magnificent
egotism of a design, in which he consciously destined
for himself the leading part. As one of his closest
friends of those days said, "his confidence in men was
great and in himself unlimited." "All great national
movements," he wrote in later years, "begin with
unknown men of the people, without influence except
for the faith and will, that counts not time or difficulties."
It is worth noting that Camillo Cavour, five
years younger still, was at this same time writing to
a friend that "he would one fine morning wake up
Prime Minister of Italy."</p>

<p>When we disentangle Mazzini's ideas from the
superfluous verbiage that sometimes wraps them, two
leading principles are found to differentiate them from
those of earlier movements,&mdash;the principles, that, with
his trick of making watchwords, he summed up in
the phrase, "God and the People." The new movement
must have the inspiration and power of a
religion. Italy needed something that would shake
her from the hopelessness of disillusion and defeat,
something that would prove she "had a strength
within her, that was arbiter of facts, mightier than
destiny itself." Action must be roused by action,
energy by energy, faith by faith,&mdash;the faith that
made Rome great and inspired Christianity and sent
forth the armies of the Convention, the faith that
makes the weak strong in the knowledge they are
carrying out God's will. Mazzini had two arguments
to persuade his countrymen to this believing and
conquering patriotism. He hoped to fire them with
his own superb faith in Italy and her destinies. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
called up "that old name of Italy, hung round with
memories and glory and majestic griefs, that centuries
of mute servitude could not destroy." Twice had she
been queen of the world; many times had she, the
land of Dante and Vico, of the Papacy and the
Renaissance, inspired European thought. "Italy,"
he said, "has been called a graveyard; but a graveyard
peopled by our mighty dead is nearer life
than a land that teems with living weaklings and
braggarts." Her task was not yet done; she had
still to speak to the nations "the gospel of the new
age, the gospel of humanity." He pointed Italians
to "the vision of their country, radiant, purified by
suffering, moving as an angel of light among the
nations that thought her dead." Rightly he judged
that men, who shared his faith, would never despair
of their country. But he had a more sounding note
to strike. He had the genius to see that he who
would have men rise to high endeavour, must appeal
to their unselfish motives, that only when some great
principle calls, will they lift themselves to heroism and
sacrifice of all that makes life dear. The effort to
make Italy meant the loss of thousands of lives,
meant exile and imprisonment and poverty, the
blighting of homes and the misery of dear ones; and
men would only face it at the call of duty. The
Carbonari had no call; they came of a school that
appealed to interested motives, and the appeal inevitably
broke down in the day of disappointment
and defeat. Mazzini offered his countrymen "a
national religion"; Young Italy was no mere political
party, but "a creed and an apostolate"; it taught that
victory came "by reverence for principles, reverence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
for the just and true, by sacrifice and constancy in
sacrifice." As individuals and as a nation, they had
a mission given them by God. God's law of duty
bade them follow it; God's law of progress promised
them accomplishment.</p>

<p>The other principle of Young Italy was social
reform. Earlier liberal movements had thought or
attempted little for the masses, though at all events
the recent rising in Romagna aimed higher than
Mazzini gave it credit for, and had more of a democratic
tendency than contemporary movements in
France and England. Mazzini exaggerated the revolutionary
impatience of the masses in 1821 and
1831; but it was true that such enthusiasm as they
had, had been cooled by the disappointment of their
hopes. Revolutions, as he said, had been Dead Sea
apples to them. They would be slow to stir again,
till they saw that the liberation of their country had
tangible social results in store. The gospel of duty
would rouse the cultured middle classes, but at this
time he seems to have thought that the uneducated,
down-trodden, priest and official-ridden masses could
not respond to the higher call, and must be won by
some visible prospect of relief from present evils.
Pope Julius' cry of "Out with the barbarian" would
not touch men, who did not see how every social
injustice leant in the last resort on Austria, how dear
food, conscription, all the petty tyranny, were fruits
of the foreign domination, that sheltered the princes
who misgoverned them. Till the masses felt this,
there was no hope of a successful war of liberation.
"Revolutions," he said, "must be made for the people
and by the people, and so long as revolutions are, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
now, the inheritance and monopoly of a single class,
and lead only to the substitution of one aristocracy
for another, we shall never find salvation." The cry of
the poor, unheard by most Italian statesmen from his
time, down to yesterday, was ever with him. "I see
the people pass before my eyes in the livery of
wretchedness and political subjection, ragged and
hungry, painfully gathering the crumbs that wealth
tosses insultingly to it, or lost and wandering in riot
and the intoxication of a brutish, angry, savage joy;
and I remember that those brutalised faces bear the
finger-print of God, the mark of the same mission as
our own. I lift myself to the vision of the future and
behold the people rising in its majesty, brothers in one
faith, one bond of equality and love, one ideal of
citizen virtue that ever grows in beauty and might;
the people of the future, unspoilt by luxury, ungoaded
by wretchedness, awed by the consciousness of its
rights and duties. And in the presence of that vision
my heart beats with anguish for the present and
glorying for the future." That they would rise in
insurrection, he had no doubt. Once make them see
whence sprang their wretchedness, where stood its
remedies, once make them feel that "God is on the
side of the down-trodden," the people of Italy would
be again what they had been in the days of the
Lombard League and the Sicilian Vespers.</p>

<p>Out of these principles,&mdash;social reform as the
immediate end of revolution and duty as its inspiration,&mdash;Mazzini
built up an elaborate political programme.
He loved system-making and hardly
apologised for it. You cannot have unity or harmony
without it, he urged, and to a certain extent he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
practical justification. It were better, as he said and
as subsequent events proved, that the nationalists
should argue out their differences before the time for
action came, and not paralyse themselves by quarrels
in front of the enemy. It was this want of a positive
programme, that was, he thought, largely responsible
for the failure of the Carbonari. Their policy had
hardly gone beyond the overthrow of the existing
governments; and they had mustered under their flag
royalists and republicans, conservatives and liberals,
with the inevitable result that after their first successes
they split their ranks and fell an easy prey. It were
wiser, so Mazzini pleaded, to be few but united. "The
strength of an association depends not on its numbers
but on its homogeneity." But the principle was necessarily
an intolerant one. It barred many a true
patriot, who could not swear to the whole Mazzinian
doctrine. For such he had no pity. In his view it
was only fear, "the Almighty God of most politicians,"
that prevented the Moderates from accepting his
position. "There can be no moderation," he said at
a later date, "between good and evil, truth and error,
progress and reaction." Unluckily truth to him too
often meant adhesion to his own theories; and he
could never forgive men, who, starting from his premisses,
could not follow his logic to the end, though,
like most men who pride themselves on being logical,
he was often singularly incapable of accurate reasoning.
It was this intolerance that wrecked so much of his
after life, that made him waste his splendid powers in
fighting men, by whose side he ought to have been
working.</p>

<p>However, for better or worse, Mazzini required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
from his fellow-workers implicit acceptance of his
theories,&mdash;theories which embraced every sphere of
national life, religion and politics, literature and art.
His chief political doctrines were republicanism and
Italian Unity. How he pieced republicanism on his
general theory of things, is the subject of another
chapter. It is sufficient here to note that he was a
republican, chiefly because he thought that democratic
legislation was impossible under any form of monarchy.
The belief was natural enough at the time. Few had
been the popular reforms under any European crown,
while the one genuine series of democratic laws had
been passed by the French Republic or while the
French monarchy was tottering to its fall. Mazzini
may be pardoned, if at that time he sharply sundered
monarchies and republics, and failed to see how imperfect
was the classification. In Italy, Mazzini saw
special circumstances that made for a republic. Her
great memories were republican, though even he must
have recognised how little the republics of medieval
Italy had in common with his ideal polity. At Venice
and his own Genoa the republican tradition was still
dear. Italian republicanism was free from any recent
memory of outrage and proscription, such as tarnished
the name in France. And above all, he urged, there
was no possible king for a united Italy. Each prince
was pledged to Austria, each had proved his sympathy
with reaction. Monarchy in Italy had "no splendid
annals, no venerable traditions," no powerful nobility
to buttress it. Two princes only had an army, which
could help in the war of liberation; and neither the
King of Piedmont nor the King of Naples would
submit to the other without a bitter civil struggle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
And the antipathies of North and South, though they
might bow to the principle of a common republic,
would never allow the Neapolitan to take a king
from Piedmont. History has proved how wrong
was his diagnosis, and temporarily and reluctantly
he had glimpses of his error. More than once
in after life, as we shall see, he alternated his republicanism
with fits of half-belief in the Piedmontese
monarchy.</p>

<p>His advocacy of Italian Unity rests on a surer
bottom. That the country was fated to stagnate till
the foreigner had gone, was common ground with
every school of patriots. But when the Austrians
had been driven out, was Italy to be a federation of
states or one united country? Mazzini pleaded that
the point at issue between him and the federalists
was mainly one of practicability. This hardly took
sufficient account of the school, which looked to
Switzerland and America for its types, and preferred
a federation on its own merits. But on the whole his
contention was right. Every argument that told for
federation, told yet more forcibly for unity. The
strength of the federalist movement lay in the belief
that unity was impossible. As yet, though Napoleon
had foretold that unity must come, only a handful of
Italians had dared to speak of it as a possible ideal.
The great majority doubted whether Italy even wished
to be united, whether, if she did, the facts of the
European polity made it possible, whether unity could
permanently stand the strain of the old provincial
animosities. It was easy for them to adduce a host
of facts,&mdash;the differences of race and temperament
and tradition, the various habits formed by dissimilar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
systems of law and land tenure and education, the
jealousies, still far from dead, that sundered province
from province and city from city. Mazzini himself
had felt the force of their arguments, and there was
a moment, when even he had been shaken in his
faith. He had little tangible reasoning to back his
confidence. But he had the prophetic assurance of
a great possibility, and his contagious faith made it a
reality. He saw, when hardly another of his contemporaries
saw it, that Italian Unity was a practicable
ideal; his teaching informed the national resolve, that
changed the seemingly impossible into a fact. To
few men has it been given to create a great political
idea; to fewer still to be not only the creator, but the
chief instrument in realising it. Mazzini was both,
and it gives him title to rank among the makers of
modern Europe.</p>

<p>But there could be no unity, no republic, no
political advance of any kind, till the inevitable war
with Austria had been fought and won. She would
not surrender her Italian provinces, unless by force
of arms. She could not tolerate free institutions side
by side with her own despotic rule. She had crushed
the Neapolitan and Piedmontese risings ten years
before; she had done the same in Modena and
Romagna yesterday. "She robs us," said Mazzini,
"of life and country, name, glory, culture, material
well-being." As Giusti said more pointedly a few
years later, the Italians "ate Austria in their bread."
Mazzini and many another patriot knew that any
peaceful solution was utopian. "The destinies of
Italy," he preached, "have to be decided on the plains
of Lombardy, and peace must be signed beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Alps." Mazzini rather welcomed war in a just cause.
It would redeem the torpid, disillusioned Italian, who
was brave enough, as Napoleon's campaigns had
proved, but required much to nerve him to effort.
It would give Italy again her national self-respect, her
claim to the esteem of other peoples. "War," he
said, "is the eternal law, that stands between the
master and the slave who breaks his chains." But
Mazzini in his saner moods saw the futility of any
local or ill-prepared rising. In words, that condemn
only too eloquently much of his after action, he
declared that only victory could justify a rising against
Austria. It was only when the great mass of the
people had been won to the nationalist cause, that the
patriots "might stretch their hand to Lombardy and
say, 'There are the men who perpetuate your servitude,'
towards the Alps and say, 'There stand your
confines.'" Mazzini's plan of campaign was guerilla
fighting. It was, as he said, the natural resource of an
insurgent people, that had to win its freedom against
disciplined armies,&mdash;the method chosen by the Dutch
against Philip II., by the American colonists against
England, by the Spaniards and Greeks in more recent
times. Had he lived now, he might have added another
illustrious example. Italy, with her long chain of mountains
that no enemy could hold in force, had special fitness
for the strategy. "Italians," he cried, "look to your
mountains, there stand strength and infallible victory."</p>

<p>In the meantime the work of Young Italy was to
organise and educate; and the only possible organisation
was that of the secret society. Mazzini did not
see its inherent weaknesses. Young Italy soon became
as much the quarry of the spy and police agent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
as the Carbonari had been; and to the end of life
Mazzini was the victim of informers, who won his
easy confidence. The society developed an uncontrolled
and irresponsible leadership, and its chief,
eager as he was and sincerely eager to disclaim any
desire to dictate, was too impatient, too self-confident
to allow fair play to other men's convictions. As a
means of preparing for war, it failed disastrously; and
it proved an ill school for the parliamentary politics
of later days. But in a country, where any open expression
of liberal sentiment meant prison or exile,
if not the scaffold, there was no alternative; and as
an educating influence it came to be the greatest of
the forces that made Italy. Its writings, smuggled
into every corner of the land, moved many a young
thinker to a passionate resolve, that bore its fruit in
after times. At this stage, however, Mazzini was
hardly looking to the slow results of political education.
The hour of insurrection, he confidently believed,
was near; the European revolution was threatening, and
Italy must not be behind the sister nations. He was
certain of success. Whatever difficulties might come
to a nationalist movement without a backing from the
native governments, however much Italians might distrust
their own unaided strength, there was "no real
obstacle for twenty-six millions of men, who wished
to rise and fight for their country." Austria, he
calculated, could at the best put two hundred thousand
men into the field; he fondly counted on four million
Italian volunteers. A people, that even under the
leading of the Carbonari had made three revolutions
in ten years, would rise again more readily and more
victoriously at the inspiration of a nobler faith.</p>

At Marseilles&mdash;Spread of Young Italy&mdash;Letter to Charles Albert&mdash;The
Army Plot in Piedmont&mdash;At Geneva&mdash;The Savoy Raid.
</p>

<p>When Mazzini arrived at Lyons, he found an unhopeful
plan in preparation for raiding Savoy. Some 2000
Italian refugees, many of them Piedmontese who had
fled through Genoa ten years before and stirred his
boyish enthusiasm, were ready to march under the hardly
concealed protection of the French government. It
was still in the early days of the July monarchy, when
it had yet not quite forgotten its revolutionary origin.
But before the expedition could start, Louis Philippe's
swift lapse into conservatism, which had already made
him break his promises to the Romagnuols, abruptly
ended the patronage of the authorities. The would-be
raiders were scattered, and Mazzini joined a small
party of republicans, who were starting for Corsica,
on their way to join the insurgents in Romagna. The
Corsicans were still Italian in sentiment as well as
race, and the Carbonaro influence was strong in the
island. Two thousand men offered themselves for
service with the insurgents, but no funds were forthcoming
to pay their passage, and before arrangements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
could be made the news arrived that the rising had
collapsed.</p>

<p>Mazzini returned to Marseilles, and found himself
among the refugees who had escaped from Central
Italy. He recruited a few young patriots among them,
and with their help he began to give body to his
schemes. In a small room at Marseilles the young
Titans started, with nothing but their own sincerity
and daring, to revolutionise Italy. "We had no office,
no helpers," he wrote of them in after years. "All day,
and a great part of the night, we were buried in our
work, writing articles and letters, getting information
from travellers, enlisting seamen, folding papers, fastening
envelopes, dividing our time between literary and
manual work. La Cecilia was compositor; Lamberti
corrected the proofs; another of us made himself literally
porter, to save the expense of distributing the papers.
We lived as equals and brothers; we had but one
thought, one hope, one ideal to reverence. The foreign
republicans loved and admired us for our tenacity and
unflagging industry; we were often in real want, but
we were light-hearted in a way, and smiling because
we believed in the future."</p>

<p>In later life Mazzini looked back longingly to the
freshness and enthusiasm of those days, before failure
had disillusioned him or misunderstanding estranged
him from his friends. When he was well and happy,
all the charm of his nature&mdash;his radiant idealism, his
warm-hearted friendship, his contagious unselfishness&mdash;made
him the beloved inspirer of the little band
that worked under his orders. "He was," said an
Italian of him at this time, "about 5 feet 8 inches
high and slightly made; he was dressed in black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Genoa velvet, with a large "republican" hat; his long,
curling black hair, which fell upon his shoulders, the
extreme freshness of his clear olive complexion, the
chiselled delicacy of his regular and beautiful features,
aided by his very youthful look and sweetness and
openness of expression, would have made his appearance
almost too feminine, if it had not been for his
noble forehead, the power of firmness and decision
that was mingled with their gaiety and sweetness in
the bright flashes of his dark eyes and in the varying
expression of his mouth, together with his small and
beautiful moustachios and beard. Altogether he was
at that time the most beautiful being, male or female,
that I had ever seen, and I have not since seen his
equal."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But sometimes even now overwork and
impatience told on him, and he felt ill and exhausted.
In such moods he must have been a trying man to
be much with&mdash;irritable, exacting, requiring absolute
submission from his fellow-workers, angry if they
thought well of men whom he disliked.</p>

<p>For two years the little band worked on, sowing the
seeds of revolution. It was a heroic enterprise. A
few young men, without birth or wealth to help them,
and, except for their leader, of no great ability, were
planning to change the future of their country and preparing
for war with a great military empire. To an
outsider it must have seemed a madman's dream.
But their masterful chief had taught them his own
faith; and they, and thousands of their countrymen
after them, found in it the power, to which few things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
are impossible. They worked with remorseless energy,
month after month, corresponding with sympathisers
all over the peninsula, planting lodges of Young Italy
wherever a chance opened, drawing together the threads
of conspiracy. They found abundant backing in Italy.
Mazzini appealed to his followers there to work among
the people by every road that the despotism left open,
to bring children to school and teach them, to hold
classes for men in the country districts, to circulate
pictures and pamphlets and almanacs, which would
insinuate patriotic ideas without exciting the suspicions
of the police, to carry the cross of fire from town to
town and village to village. "Climb the hills," he
asked of them, "sit at the farmer's table, visit the
workshops and the artisans, whom you now neglect.
Tell them of their rightful liberties, their ancient
traditions and glories, the old commercial greatness
which has gone; talk to them of the thousand
forms of oppression, which they ignore, because no
one points them out." His appeal found a ready
response. Hundreds of young Italians, fired by his
own passion, gave themselves to the dangers and toils
and the thousand small annoyances of a conspirator's
life. It was no light call. "I know of no existence,"
said one of them in later life, "which requires such
continual self-abnegation and endurance. A conspirator
has to listen to all sorts of gossip, to soothe
every variety of vanity, discuss nonsense seriously, feel
sick and stifling under the pressure of empty talk, idle
boasting, and vulgarity, and yet maintain an unmoved
and complacent countenance. A conspirator ceases to
belong to himself, and becomes the toy of anyone he
may meet; he must go out when he would rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
stay at home, and stay at home when he would rather
go out; he has to talk when he would be silent, and
to hold vigils when he would rather be in bed." And
behind these petty vexations, which meant more to the
Italians of that day than to a generation trained in
strenuousness, lay the knowledge that discovery meant
prison or exile, perhaps death. But they faced it with
the courage of men who believed that the "wear and
tear was smoothing the way, inch by inch, towards a
noble and holy end," who looked to the day when
through their labours their country would be lifted
from the slough of misgovernment and low ideals.
Life and everything they were ready to give for that.
"Here are we," said Jacopo Ruffini to his fellow-conspirators
at Genoa, "five young, very young men,
with but limited means, and we are called on to do
nothing less than overthrow an established government.
I have a presentiment that few of us will live
to see the final results of our labours, but the seed we
have sown will shoot forth after us, and the bread we
have cast upon the waters will be found again."</p>

<p>Mazzini might well be sanguine, with men like
these behind him. He looked to his literature to
do the rest. The journal of Young Italy was, as he
described it, "a collection of political pamphlets," each
of the infrequent and irregular numbers consisting of
a hundred to two hundred pages, badly printed on
bad paper. Later on, it was set up by French compositors,
who knew no Italian, and whose misprints
gave him infinite concern. He himself did most of the
writing. It was terribly diffusive often and wanting in
precision, but his articles redeem their literary defects
by the glow of noble purpose, that made them thrill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
their readers, and gave them a potency, that perhaps
no other political writings of the century attained to.
Most of the remaining articles came from his fellow-workers.
Mazzini tried to persuade Sismondi to contribute,
but the historian, though sympathetic, was too
opposed to some of his teaching to respond. Louis
Napoleon, drawn by a fellow-feeling for conspiracy
and scenting a chance to preach Bonapartism, sent an
essay on Military Honour, with the thesis that soldiers
are not bound by their oath to act against a revolution.
Mazzini consented to insert it with many
emendations, which apparently left little of its Bonapartist
intention; but for some reason that does not
appear, it was not published. The journal had a small
circulation, and only reached a limited number of
young educated men; it was indeed too literary for
popular consumption. There seems to have been a
larger demand for rules and instructions and popular
tracts written by Gustavo Modena, afterwards to
become one of the most famous Italian tragedians of
his day. At all events there was a considerable contraband
of printed matter, smuggled to Genoa or
Leghorn or across the passes into Piedmont, inside
barrels of pitch and pumice stone or bales of drapery
or packages of sausages. So great became the demand,
that secret presses were set up in Italy and the Ticino
to supplement the output from Marseilles.</p>

<p>The results surpassed even Mazzini's sanguine hopes.
The first lodges of Young Italy were planted at Genoa
and Leghorn, and they spread thence to a good many
towns of North and Central Italy. The chief strength
of the society lay at Genoa, where the nationalist and
anti-Piedmontese parties made common cause, and men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of every class came in&mdash;nobles and commoners, lawyers
and civil servants and priests, seamen and artisans.
Outside Genoa the working men seem to have kept
aloof as a rule; years had yet to pass before Mazzini's
social teaching reached them. The recruits came chiefly
from the young men of the middle classes, sons of the
men who had had their importance under the French
rule and had been cribbed and kept under since the
restoration. Here and there a young noble joined;
in Piedmont and at Genoa at all events there was a
sprinkling of older professional and business men; a
few priests welcomed a movement, which bore so
strong a religious imprint. Everywhere the scattered
remnants of the Carbonari enrolled themselves.
Buonarrotti, <i>doyen</i> of the conspirators, descendant of
Michelangelo, friend of Robespierre and Bab&oelig;uf and
Napoleon, attached his society of the <i>Veri Italiani</i>.
Early in 1833 Mazzini, it is impossible to say with
what accuracy, put the number of affiliates at fifty or
sixty thousand. Many a man, who came to the front
in the later nationalist movement or in the first Italian
parliaments, began his political life as a member of
Young Italy. Garibaldi, a young sailor who wrote
verses, just promoted to be captain in the Genoese
mercantile marine, whose fearlessness and charm of
manner made him the idol of the men under him,
and who had already learnt from Foscolo a belief in
the destinies of Italy as ardent as Mazzini's own, met
the chief at Marseilles and joined the society. Gioberti,
who was teaching a transcendental and literary
patriotism to the novices in the Archbishop's seminary
at Vercelli, sent warm words of encouragement to the
cause of God and the People.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>All Mazzini's preparations centred round Piedmont
and Genoa. He realised, with the bulk of patriots of
whatever school, that though the other provinces might
play a secondary part, Piedmont must take the lead.
It was the only state that possessed the military
training and traditions, essential in a war; it was the
natural base for an invasion of Lombardy; Alessandria
and Genoa were two all-important strategic points,
and if the Italians were defeated in the plains, they
could fall back on the Alps and Apennines. There
were few republicans among the Piedmontese, but
they were nationalists with all their race's tenacity of
purpose. The Genoese were zealots for the cause, all
the more if it were under a republican flag; in Savoy
there was a strong strain of liberalism, and its position
made it a connecting link with sympathisers in France.
Mazzini's first public act&mdash;some three or four months
after he left Italy&mdash;was to write an open letter to the
king. Charles Albert had just ascended the throne of
Piedmont; and expectation ran high, as it had run
ten years before, that he would lead the nationalists.
This time there was small bottom for the hope.
Charles Albert had had his phase of liberalism; in
his youth he had relations with the Carbonari, and
encouraged the Piedmontese conspirators of 1821 to
look to him to lead the army to a war for Lombard
independence. Had he had the courage, he would
have stood by his word. But as he was then, so was
he now, a moral coward, buffeted by irreconcilable
ambitions. He was still a nationalist, but no liberal.
Liberalism had come to loom before him as a spectre
of Revolution, to be fought and crushed without pity.
But priest-ridden absolutist as he was, he never quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
forgot his patriotic faith, he always had some vision,
faint though it often was, of an Italy untrodden by
the foreign soldier. It is probable that even now, in
his worst years, he was waiting dubiously for the distant
day, when he would measure himself with the enemy.
But he knew that as yet this was impossible. He had
a saner view than Mazzini of the possibilities of the
time, when France&mdash;on the high road to the <i>juste-milieu</i>&mdash;would
give no help, and a single-handed fight
with Austria was foredoomed to defeat. He would
have scorned an offer of Mazzini's guerilla bands; but
had he been as ready to welcome the volunteers, as
his son was twenty-eight years later, they had little
prospect of existence at this time outside Mazzini's
visionary hopes.</p>

<p>Such was Charles Albert, when Mazzini appealed
to him to lead the nationalist movement. What was
the exact purpose of the letter, will probably never
be known. In after life Mazzini denied that there
was any serious intention in it; he pleaded that he
expressed the hopes of others rather than his own,
and wrote it in the certainty that its appeal would
not be heard. At the time he disclaimed, though
not so emphatically, any hope of a response, and
suggested that its object was to disillusion the Piedmontese
of any belief in their king. There is some
reason for thinking that the disclaimers must not be
taken quite literally. When he wrote twenty years
and more afterwards, he was anxious to prove that
he had never lapsed from his republican faith. His
earlier commentary was in a letter to a man, whom
he did not know, and to whom he was not likely to
express himself unreservedly. There are indications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
that he had not quite escaped the glamour that Charles
Albert threw over the liberals, had not entirely abandoned
all hope of winning him. The secret instructions
of Young Italy, written a few months later,
accepted the possibility of a monarchy as a "system
of transition"; and in the subsequent army plot
Mazzini intended to offer the King the leadership of
the revolution. One would fain believe that his own
interpretations do him injustice, that he did not write
his glowing prose in utter insincerity. Were it otherwise,
we must bow the head and sadly own a stain
upon that noble life.</p>

<p>The letter, it must be confessed, was hardly calculated
to make a convert. Threats alternate with overdone
praise; the assumption of political omniscience,
the claim of the young exile to speak for Italy, the
magniloquent parade of the obvious, must have, like
much else of his earlier writings, offended Italian
common-sense and been extremely irritating. Much
of it reads like a declamatory school essay on the
duties of a constitutional king. But the lesson was
true enough on its negative side. Charles Albert
could find no safe foothold outside popular government;
coercion, administrative reform, the support of
Austria or France&mdash;none would permanently content
or overawe his people. And if Charles Albert had
retorted that to grant a constitution meant war with
Austria, Mazzini would have welcomed the corollary.
The King was right and Mazzini was wrong as to the
inopportuneness of a national rising at the moment.
But for the policy of another day, the letter has
passages that speak like a trumpet call. "Sire, there
is another road, leading to true power and a glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
immortality; another ally, safer and more strong than
Austria or France. There is a crown more brilliant
and sublime than that of Piedmont, a crown that
waits the man, who dares to think of it, who
dedicates his life to winning it, and scorns to dull its
splendour with thoughts of petty tyranny. Sire, have
you never cast an eagle glance upon this Italy, so fair
with nature's smile, crowned by twenty centuries of
noble memory, the land of genius, strong in the infinite
resources that only want a common purpose, girt round
with barriers so impregnable, that it needs but a firm
will and a few brave breasts to shelter it from foreign
insult? Place yourself at the head of the nation,
write on your flag, 'Union, Liberty, Independence.'
Free Italy from the barbarian, build up the future,
be the Napoleon of Italian freedom. Do this and we
will gather round you, we will give our lives for you,
we will bring the little states of Italy under your flag.
Your safety lies on the sword's point; draw it and
throw away the scabbard. But remember, if you do
it not, others will do it without you and against you."</p>

<p>The letter was published in May or June 1831, and
a few copies found their way into Italy. Mazzini
thought he had evidence that the King read it. At
all events his police did, and ordered the writer whose
anonymity did not conceal him, to be seized, if he
crossed the frontier. Whatever Mazzini's hopes may
have been, this proved that the letter had failed in its
ostensible object, and he threw himself feverishly into
his preparations for a revolt in Piedmont. His detailed
scheme shows that he had not yet planned or had
abandoned for the time the strategy of guerilla fighting,
and intended to rely on the Piedmontese army. Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Albert was, if possible, to be persuaded to lead the
revolution, and the army was to be mobilised for an
immediate advance on Lombardy. Should the King
decline the offer, a provisional directorate at Genoa
would assume the government. Mazzini had better
ground for his hopes than often afterwards. The army
had not forgotten that it had led the constitutional and
nationalist movement ten years before. Many a soldier,
who had served in the <i>Grande Armée</i>, cherished the
democratic sentiment that clung to it all through, and
was eager to avenge himself on the enemy, whom
he had routed in old days. These feelings were
especially strong among the non-commissioned officers.
Many of them were men of the middle classes of
good standing and education, for in many, if not all,
of the regiments commissions could be held only by those
of noble birth, and no bourgeois, whatever his capacities,
could rise above the ranks. A few officers joined the
society, and a general or two promised to throw in
his lot, if the movement proved successful. At
Alessandria and Genoa, the two chief garrison towns,
the society had a considerable strength. The government,
though quietly tracking the civilian conspirators,
seems to have had no suspicion of the army plot; and
had the revolt broken out early in 1833, it would have
had its chance of success at home, though the inevitable
disaster must have come, when the little army faced
the Austrians.</p>

<p>But the conspirators waited too long, and late in
the spring an accident led to the discovery of the plot.
The government cautiously followed up the clue, till it
possessed itself of every detail of the conspiracy.
Then it threw itself on its prey with a savage vengeance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
that outside the Austrian provinces has had no
parallel in Italy since the days of Fra Diavolo. Charles
Albert, pitiless with fright, surrendered himself to the
reactionary court party and fed their thirst for blood.
Moral, sometimes physical, torture was inflicted on the
victims to extort confession of their own or their confederates'
guilt. Jacopo Ruffini, given the choice
between execution and the betrayal of his friends,
committed suicide in prison. Ten soldiers and two
civilians were shot; fourteen more only escaped by
flight; numbers were sent to longer or shorter imprisonment.
Italy still execrates those courts-martial.
Not all Charles Albert's later patriotism has purged
his memory from their indelible shame; and while
yet he reigned, the Genoese erased from their city
every record of the brutal general who was his worst
instrument. The humble lawyers and sergeants whom
he shot, have a deathless homage from their country.
"Ideas ripen quickly," said Mazzini, "when nourished
by the blood of martyrs." It was the memory of
these and other victims of tyranny, that helped to
nerve Italian arms and send Italians to die in the
battles that won their country's liberty.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, since the previous August, Mazzini had
been driven into hiding at Marseilles. The French
government decreed his banishment and broke up his
press. Mazzini eluded both blows. He started a
secret press and got French compositors to work it.
He himself found refuge in the house of a French
sympathiser, Démosthène Ollivier, father of Louis
Napoleon's last premier, under whose roof he remained
"a voluntary prisoner." Twice only in the year he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
passed its threshold, and then only at night, disguised
as a woman or a <i>garde national</i>. It was at this time
that the French government, whether maliciously or
itself deceived, brought against him a false charge of
encouraging assassination, for repeating which in after
years Sir James Graham wore sackcloth.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Mazzini
was still at Marseilles, when the news of the Genoese
executions came; and so terrible was his anguish, for
in Jacopo Ruffini he had lost his dearest friend, that
his health and mind nearly broke down. The devotion
of a noble woman, whom he loved,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> saved him from
insanity or death.</p>

<p>About the beginning of July 1833 he moved to
Geneva. He came there to be on the spot for a new
plan of insurrection. The failure of the army plot
only impelled him more feverishly into his fixed idea
of a rising in Piedmont. He wished no doubt to
punish Charles Albert, and well may he have been
maddened by the savagery, which had sickened
Europe. He wanted to "moralise" his party by
proving that the terrorism had no fears for him and
striking back at the victorious and brutal enemy.
He thought that, if he was to keep his following together,
he must make his cast now or never. Once
allow the fire to slack down, and it would be beyond
his power to rekindle it. He believed that half
Europe was on the brink of revolution, that a republican
movement in Italy would be the signal for
republican risings in France and Spain and Germany.
It was probably a fantastic dream; but he had surer
ground for thinking that a revolt would fire the tinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
throughout Italy. Exaggerated as his hopes were
even here, the revolutionary spirit, that Young Italy
created, had sunk deep. In the Genovesate and
Savoy, in the Papal States and parts of Naples there
was a good deal of material ready for an insurrection;
and Mazzini had assured himself that on the appointed
day guerilla bands would take to the mountains in
several districts. The chances of success, indeed,
were not bright at the best; but the raid was not
quite the unpardonable playing with brave lives, that
it seems at first sight. Mazzini, taking up a plan of
the Carbonari at Paris, chose Savoy for the starting-point
of the insurrection. He expected that the troops
there would join the insurgents, and the revolutionary
army would cross the Alps into Piedmont, while
another band would land in the Riviera and rouse
the Genoese country.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>By the autumn of 1833 several hundred exiles had
been enrolled in Switzerland. Many of them were
Poles and Germans, a few were French; and Mazzini
welcomed assistance, which he hoped might cement
an international alliance of democrats, and develop
into a "Young Europe," which would do elsewhere
what Young Italy was doing for his own country.
He had the help of several officers, Bianco di San
Jorioz, author of a clever book on guerilla warfare,
which had much influenced him, and Manfredo Fanti,
the future organiser of the Italian army. They saw
the importance of giving the command to an experienced
officer, and the Savoyard conspirators
insisted that the choice should fall on a certain
General Ramorino, a cosmopolitan adventurer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Savoyard birth, who had fought under Napoleon, and
had an undistinguished command in the Polish rising of
1831. Mazzini's slender preparations were completed
by October, and about eight hundred men were armed
and ready to march. There were plans of simultaneous
risings at Genoa and Naples, in the Marches
and the Abruzzi; and Garibaldi enlisted in the
Piedmontese navy in the quixotic hope of bringing
it over to the revolution. But what chance there was
of success was spoilt by Ramorino. He had no real
interest in the expedition; perhaps he was paid by
the French government to wreck it. At all events
he lingered at Paris, squandering much of the war-fund,
that Mazzini had collected with infinite labour.
Every week added to the difficulties. The foreign
governments put pressure on the Swiss to break up
the volunteers. Buonarrotti, suspicious of the whole
design, did his best to discredit Mazzini among his
own men. When Mazzini at last insisted that the
volunteers must wait no longer, the conspirators in
Savoy refused to cooperate unless Ramorino came.
Mazzini worked desperately to undo the mischief, and
at last, in January, Ramorino arrived. It was too
late. The Swiss authorities harassed the volunteers,
and on February 1 only a small body of the raiders
could gather on the frontier near St Julien. Ramorino
marched them aimlessly about. Probably he saw
from the first how desperate were the chances, and
wished to spare a useless loss of life. On the 4th,
before hardly a shot had been exchanged, he disbanded
his men, and the insurrection was still-born.</p>

</p>

<p>During the raid Mazzini's health collapsed. The
strain of work and anxiety might have broken down
a stronger man; he had not touched his bed for a
week, and fatigue and cold and the crushing responsibility
brought on fever. There was a false alarm one
night, and a patrol fired; and Mazzini, hurrying up
excitedly with his musket, lost consciousness and did
not regain it till the volunteers had recrossed the
frontier. The collapse unstrung him for the time,
and perhaps it was only the letters of the woman he
loved, that kept him from a worse fate. "I have
moral convulsions," he writes to her; "there are
moments when I could roll on the ground and bite
myself. I have fits of rage at every human face and
voice." When he recovered, he found his residence
in Switzerland threatened. The foreign governments
rained threats on the Federal Diet to make it expel
the refugees. The Diet was easily frightened, but
even had it been braver, it could not tolerate acts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
contrary to international law, or allow Switzerland
to be a recruiting ground for raids upon a neighbouring
power. The Swiss could not be expected to risk
foreign complications for the sake of men who, from
any ordinary standpoint, had abused their hospitality.
After what had happened, it was difficult for the
raiders to plead at once even the traditional right of
asylum for political refugees; and though after a lapse
of time a stronger government would have reverted
to the more generous policy, and though some of
the cantons were restive at its continued deference
to foreign pressure, it is not easy to blame the Diet,
even at a later date, for its unwillingness to shelter
the raiders.</p>

<p>Many of them were sent at once across the frontier;
others succeeded in hiding themselves. Mazzini was
determined not to leave Switzerland. It was essential
to his plans that he should be near Italy, and he
dreaded moving further from the beloved land. He
grew fond of Switzerland, and came to "love the Alps
almost as one loves a mother." England and America
were the only other countries open to him, and he
feared that if a Tory government came into power
in England, he would find no shelter even there.
"Besides," he said, in words to be recanted later,
"there is no sympathy there, no help, no anything."
For nearly three years he led a more or less hunted
life&mdash;at Lausanne, at Berne, at Soleure and Bienne
and Grenchen, in the house of a Protestant pastor at
Langnau; sometimes hotly sought by the police, sometimes
with the connivance of the government, but
generally a virtual prisoner in the houses where he found
a refuge. For seven months, at one time, he fled from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
place to place, living in apparently untenanted houses,
with mats at the windows, never setting foot outside,
except in his fugitive removes by night across the
mountains. Exhausted in body and soul, he had to
taste an exile's life in all its bitterness; "the existence
mournful and dull as a stormy sky or the ashes of a
dead fire; the suffering that has no name, that finds
no vent in tears or words, that has no poetry save for
the distant sentimentalist; the suffering that makes
a man wan and hollow-cheeked but kills not, that
bows but does not break; while the weary eyes follow
the driven clouds, that the wind wafts away to the
skies of fatherland, beyond the everlasting Alps, those
icy cherubim that guard the gate of the heart's
Eden."</p>

<p>There was little interruption to his desolate solitude.
Save for occasional glimpses, he was parted from his
old comrades, except the Ruffinis; and though he
found a few sympathetic friends in Switzerland and
caught greedily at their affections, it could not make
up for the loss. He had few books; "I could well
live all my life shut up in one room," he wrote wearily,
"if I had all my books at hand, but without books, or
guitar, or view, it is too much." The sedentary life
told on his health, and he obstinately declined the
medicines his mother sent him. Toothache wore him
down, though sometimes he welcomed it as a diversion
from his sickness of heart. Money difficulties came,
with their sordid complications. His mother sent
what she could spare; friends helped him with loans.
But he could never refuse an exile in need, and they
importuned him, till even he rebelled against their
exigencies. The organisation of Young Italy&mdash;such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of it as still was left&mdash;and expenses of publishing and
postage absorbed most of the rest, for there were few
subscribers to the party funds. He denied himself
all but bare necessities and cigars, even the two small
luxuries he valued&mdash;scent and good writing paper.
He borrowed what few books he had. He went short
of clothes, and sends his mother lean inventories of
his wardrobe, which she and his old nurse did their
best to replenish. Sometimes he found himself in
absolute want, and writes "with a blush on his face"
to the mother who never refused him. Aching fits of
home-sickness came on him, "a physical craving for
home, for Italian clouds and winds and sea." "The
other day," he writes to a little girl friend, "I was
looking at the Alps in the distance&mdash;beyond them is
my country, my poor country that I love so much,
where my father and mother are, and my two sisters,
and another sister who has been dead many years,
and the tomb of the best friend of my youth, who
died for liberty, and meadows and hills and beautiful
lakes like your own, and flowers and oranges and a
beautiful sky&mdash;all that one needs to make one die
happy, and I thought sadly on it all."</p>

<p>He had more pungent thoughts to trouble him.
The disastrous raid demoralised his party. From
Italy came news of discouragement and desertion.
The exiles loaded him with the responsibility of the
fiasco; he found himself the centre of a miserable
cross-fire of recrimination, and he repaid the criticism
with scorn and suspicion. The want of response in Italy
made him at times very bitter against his countrymen.
"Oh, how cold those Italians are, and how they hunt
for excuses for their apathy. They will not see that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
they are slaves, without a name, accursed by God, and
mocked among the nations." The human sweetness
in him was half dried up, and a misanthropy, so new
and alien to him, made him querulous and captious.
Friends were cold, or at all events seemed so to his
sick mind. He wrote peevishly to the best of them;
probably he talked more peevishly still. The society,
even of those who were dearest, worried and distressed
him, and he preferred to be left alone with a favourite
cat. "I am inclined to love men at a distance," he
writes; "contact makes me hate them." The sorest
pain, one that obsessed him and dragged him to the
abyss, was the thought of his suffering friends, suffering
because of him, though for a cause for which he too
had given all. It was the Gethsemane of every true-hearted
man, who calls his fellows forth to sacrifice and
battle. The friends of his youth were in exile. Men
who had loved him and whom he had loved, were
laying their misery to his charge. The Ruffinis' home
was desolate&mdash;one son the victim of his own hand,
two more in exile, the mother, whom of all women he
reverenced most, sitting in loneliness and mourning.
Another woman, to whom he had given his love, but
to whom a fugitive exile could not give a home, was
hunted by the Italian police, worn and desperate.
"What gives me pain and very sad moments," he
writes to his mother, "is the past and present and
future of the few beings who love me and whom I
really love, you, and the Ruffinis, their mother, my
sisters, and Her. If I could see you all and my few
other friends, I will not say happy, for that we can
never be again, but tranquil, quiet, smiling, and united,
I would die that day with rapture." "I wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
do good," he writes to a friend, "but I have always
done harm to everybody, and the thought grows and
grows till I think I shall go mad. Sometimes I fancy
I am hated by those I love most." Once, at all events,
it made him doubt of all that he had done. "I think
over it from morning to night, and ask pardon of my
God for having been a conspirator; not that I in the
least repent the reasons for it, or recant a single one of
my beliefs, which were, and are, and will be a religion
to me, but because I ought to have seen that there are
times, when a believer should only sacrifice himself to
his belief. I have sacrificed everybody."</p>

<p>The black misery settled on him. "I felt alone in
the world, except for my poor mother, and she too
was away and unhappy for my sake, and I stopped in
terror at the void. In that wilderness I met Doubt."
The men whom he had sent to a patriot's death,
had they died in vain? Was it all a frightful error,
an empty dream born of ambition and pride of
intellect? Was it for some grandiose, impossible
chimera, that he had taken men from quiet useful
lives and the simple round of kindliness? What
authority had he still to preach a creed, which meant
the sacrifice of thousands more, the unhappiness of
many another mother? In his nightly terrors, in his
little lonely room, while the wind howled round, he
heard Jacopo Ruffini's voice calling to him. He was
of course verging on insanity, and thoughts of suicide
passed through his mind. His strong moral nature
and the influence of two women&mdash;Madame Ruffini and
one unknown&mdash;saved him. Characteristically, mental
health returned in the shape of a philosophy of life.
It was his theory of Duty, expanded till it penetrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
every cranny of the individual soul. His old enemy,
the utilitarian theory, had taken subtle root in his
affections. "I should have thought of them, as of
a blessing from God, to be accepted with thankfulness,
not as of something to be expected and exacted as a
right and a reward. Instead of this, I had made them
a condition of fulfilling my duties. I had not reached
the ideal of love, love that has no hope in this life.
I had worshipped not love but the joys of love."
And so he put away that last infirmity of the true
man, took to himself not only toil and danger and
opprobrium, but unloved solitude of soul, the desert
life of him who has no friend but God. He, who
ached for sympathy and love, took duty for his hard
task-master&mdash;duty, "an arid, bare religion, which does
not save my heart a single atom of unhappiness, but
still the only one that can save me from suicide."
"There are four lines of Juvenal," he said, "that sum
up all we ought to ask of God, all that made Rome
the mistress and the benefactress of the world:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'Pray for the soul, that has no fear of death,</p>
<p>That holds life's end among kind nature's gifts,</p>
<p>Brave to endure each pain and labour; nought</p>
<p>Vexes it, nought it covets.'"</p>
</div>

<p>"When a man," he writes to a friend, "has once
said to himself in all seriousness of thought and
feeling, I believe in liberty and country and humanity,
he is bound to fight for liberty and country and
humanity, fight long as life lasts, fight always, fight
with every weapon, face all from death to ridicule,
face hatred and contempt, work on because it is his
duty and for no other reason."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Long indeed before his mental crisis, the light and
joy had gone out of his work. There were times
when he felt he had neither strength nor time nor
capacity for it, when his theories became cold, emotionless
abstractions, far other than the passionate beliefs
of other days. God was "a geometrical solution," his
own task "a fated mission." All life seemed drab
and purposeless. "There is so much agony in life,"
he writes, "that when I see a baby quiet, smiling, at
peace, I can only wish for death for it." Perhaps
though such moods were the exception. "He is almost
always good-tempered and sometimes gay," wrote
Giovanni Ruffini. Certainly during these three years
he wrote some of his warmest and humanest pages.
At times he was even hopeful of his immediate
political schemes. He was strong in the sense of his
mission. "I know," he said, "there is the future in
this life of mine, little matter if I see it." "We have
made," he writes, "the cause of the people our own,
we have voluntarily taken on ourselves the sorrows of
all a generation. We have snatched a spark from the
Eternal God, and placed ourselves between Him and
the people; we have taken on ourselves the part of
the emancipator, and God has accepted us."</p>

<p>Alike in hours of insight and of gloom he remained
ever constant to his work. His friends advised him
to retire. His father threatened, his mother entreated.
To the latter he "would have yielded, if he could."
He would gladly have withdrawn, at least he thought
so, if anyone else had come forward to take up the
work; but this of course was impossible. He would
have liked to fall back on the Manzonian policy, and
devote himself to quiet moral and literary education.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
But this seemed an impossible solution in a country,
where there was no freedom of speech or writing.
The only way, he thought, to rouse his countrymen
was to give them the example of a life, that no
adversity could turn back, no want of response dishearten,
ever labouring and suffering for their sake
and the ideal's. There must be no folding of the
hands, because others were slow to follow.</p>

<p>He set himself to think why the revolutions of the
last five years had failed, why the people, whether in
Italy or France or elsewhere, had been so deaf to the
call to liberty. He was always asking himself why
it was that Christianity had succeeded, and why a
movement, that had so much in common with it, the
movement for the social and political redemption of
the people, had failed. He found his answer in the
fact that the Revolution had missed the spiritual
power, that made Christianity triumphant. It was
the substance of his Marseilles teaching, but informed
with a more mystical, transcendental spirit, due no
doubt to the apocalyptic results of his depression, and
partly too to the influence that Lamennais had over
him at this time. The French Revolution had appealed
to men's selfish and personal interests, their
rights, their desire for happiness. It had been a
rebellion against evil, not a mission in search of good.
It had had its use, but now it had done its work.
The principle of liberty and human dignity was accepted
everywhere in theory, however much realisation
lagged. The nineteenth century was plagiarising
the eighteenth, and following precedents whose day
was past. A new principle was needed to carry progress
one step further, and that principle must be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
spiritual one. "We fell as a political party, we must
rise again as a religious party." The new revolution
must find its strength in "the enthusiasm, which alone
begets great things"; it must appeal to men's sense of
duty, it must bid them work not for themselves but
for humanity. Then and not till then, the pettiness
and party feeling and want of earnestness, which had
wrecked the movements of 1831 and his own Italian
schemes, would vanish in the light of a great faith,
and that same light would be a beacon, which would
draw the masses after.</p>

<p>He was still, in spite of disappointment and the
scepticism of his friends, convinced that Europe was
ripe for revolution, if only one country showed the
way. He was equally convinced that Italy would be
that country. France, he thought, had disqualified
herself by her adherence to the traditions of her
Revolution. The strong dislike of France, which
marked him all through life, was now especially prominent,
and he declared that popular progress throughout
Europe depended on emancipation from her political
and literary influence. Why he appropriated for Italy
the revolutionary hegemony, he would have found it
difficult to give a convincing reason. At bottom,
probably, with the sublime prophetic confidence that
went hand in hand with all his searchings of heart
and absence of personal ambition, he claimed the
primacy for his country, because he hoped to inform
her with his own principles.</p>

<p>His Italian programme remained almost unaltered.
He was indeed prepared, though regretfully, to support
a royalist movement, if it declared for Italian Unity.
But he would not countenance a royalist programme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
with any lesser goal. He still believed in the Republic,
both for Italy's own sake and for the example it would
give to other democracies. And he still believed in
insurrection as the only possible road to reformation
in a country, where there were no constitutional
liberties to make constitutional progress possible.
Gioberti urged to him in vain that unsuccessful insurrections
only discouraged the patriots and intensified
the oppression. Mazzini, though he promised that
he would not again encourage an insurrectionary
movement, unless it started inside the country and
independently of the exiles, argued that insurrection
was the only means to rouse the masses. It mattered
little if the first risings failed; they would keep alive
the spirit, that one day would lead to victory. His
hopes of the early triumph of the revolution grew
slowly fainter; he began to see that time, perhaps a
generation, was needed to quicken the inertia, that ages
of despotism had instilled. But every effort brought
them nearer to the goal; every slackening made it
more remote. He would not believe that sacrifice
and struggle could go unrewarded, or quiet waiting
spring from ought but cowardice. He still, though
fitfully&mdash;for want of money and the need of secrecy
and his own deepening gloom hampered him at
every turn&mdash;went on with his preparations. The
sixth number of <i>Young Italy</i> appeared in July 1834;
this was its last issue, but he persevered in the thankless
work of organisation, carrying on a voluminous
correspondence, raking in sympathisers from every
quarter, sending agents to Italy, who brought back
the same monotonous tale of discouragement and
unreadiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>He found time meanwhile to interest himself in
Swiss politics, and tried to organise a party to do
for Switzerland, what Young Italy had been doing
for his own country. Many of the Swiss naturally
resented the intrusion of a stranger. Mazzini brushed
away the objection, though he would perhaps have
been the first to criticise a foreigner, who had preached
to the Italians, as he preached to the Swiss. Switzerland,
he urged, played so important a part in the
European polity, that no one could be indifferent to
its destiny. At this time, certainly, Swiss politics
offered abundant scope for a reformer. The Federal
Pact of 1815 had undone Napoleon's comparatively
liberal constitution. The cantons were connected
by the loosest of ties; many of them were governed
by small oligarchies; class privileges depressed the
artisans and peasants. The return of the Jesuits
stirred a bitter religious struggle, which from time to
time threatened to blaze into civil war. A vigorous
reform movement had indeed recently swept away the
worst abuses inside some of the cantons; but, nothing
had been done to strengthen the bonds between them,
and the narrow cantonal life threatened to smother
the country in a "mud-death." It was impossible for
Switzerland to assert her independence or maintain
her traditions, when she had no central authority
worthy of the name. To Mazzini it meant too the
absence of any real national life, the adhesion to a
policy of neutrality, which prevented the one republican
state of Europe from throwing its weight into the
European balance. Mazzini's ideal for Switzerland
was to include it with the Tyrol and Savoy in a
federation of republics, and substitute for the settlement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
of 1815 a true federal authority, representing
and responsible to the whole people and not to the
separate cantons. He founded a "Young Switzerland"
society, and published a paper, <i>La Jeune
Suisse</i>, which appeared twice a week in French
and German, till after a year's existence (the usual
life of Mazzini's journalistic ventures) the Diet suppressed
it and decreed Mazzini's perpetual banishment.
In some of its articles Mazzini appears at his best,&mdash;more
tolerant, less dogmatic and theoretical. The
movement does not seem to have found any great
measure of success, though it attracted a certain
number of the finer spirits among the younger men
and Protestant clergy. But, whatever may have been
the immediate fruits of Mazzini's work, at all events
his ideas triumphed. The Swiss constitution of 1848
embodied their essentials, and it is worth noting that
Druey, one of its two draughtsmen, was his personal
friend.</p>

<p>Italy and Switzerland together were not enough to
occupy his energies. Two months after the collapse
of the Savoy raid, seventeen of the exiles, Italians,
Germans, Poles, signed a "pact of Young Europe,"
which was intended to be an alliance on Mazzinian
principles of the republicans of the three countries.
When one remembers that its vast scheme of transformation
was the work of a few young exiles, it
reads like pure rhodomontade. Mazzini himself
recognised afterwards that the plan was too embracing
to lead to practical results. But at the
time he seems to have expected a good deal from
it. It was to be a kind of "college of intellects,"
which would watch and give information on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
popular and nationalist movements of the Continent,
and at the same time be an organised propagandism
with its machinery of agents "and countless other
means." One thing in particular he hoped from it,
that it would assist towards "the emancipation from
France," and encourage another country, Italy of
course by preference, to initiate the new age of
religion and the republic. As a matter of fact,
nothing seems to have been done beyond the
despatch of a few agents to France and Spain, and
an attempt to organise meetings in England. But
it loomed large in the public eye, and did something
to teach democracy that its interests are international.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in addition to his political correspondence
and journalism, he found time for literary
writing. It was partly in the vain hope of earning
a little money for himself and his political work.
"I think over schemes day and night, as every
man in want does." It was partly too to encourage
"a religious and poetic sentiment" in Italy, and
combat the dominant scepticism and materialism.
For literary fame he cared nothing. Friends, who
wished him to retire from political work, advised
him to "honour Italy with his pen." "Excuse me,"
he answered, "but this has no meaning for me. I
don't know what or where Italy is. We must try
to regenerate and create her, and honour her afterwards."
His articles on <i>Byron and Goethe</i> and <i>The
Philosophy of Music</i> date from this period. He
collected materials for the edition of Foscolo's works,
which was so near his heart now as at a later time.
He wished to edit a collection of translated dramas,
and wrote introductions to Werner's <i>Der vierundzwanzigste
Februar</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and De Vigny's <i>Chatterton</i>. "No
other critic," says a recent Italian writer, "has written
at such length or so profoundly on Werner as did
Mazzini." The essay was published later at Brussels with
Agostino Ruffini's translation,&mdash;the only instalment of
the projected series. He planned a <i>Foreign Review</i>,
to be published at Genoa, but an indiscreet friend
betrayed his editorship, and the censorship promptly
withdrew its sanction. Another scheme for a <i>Review
of European Literature</i>, to be issued in the freer air of
Lugano, broke down, apparently for want of funds.
Another venture, which had a brief life, was the
<i>Italiano</i>, a literary and scientific magazine, which
appeared at Paris for a few months in 1836, to which
he and Tommaseo and some of the best Italian writers
of the day contributed, and where Guerrazzi published
the first chapters of his <i>Siege of Florence</i>. Mazzini,
who drafted the prospectus, seems to have been
especially anxious to include novels and poetry.
"It must be remembered," he writes, "that fancy
and the affections make up at least four-fifths of
man. Poetry is not the gift and privilege of a few,
the masses are full of a living and speaking poetry."
He urged too that women's questions should have
adequate attention.</p>

<p class="p2">It is to this period chiefly that belong the only
love-episodes of Mazzini's life. He had a lofty
conception of womanhood. "Love and respect
woman," he once wrote. "Look to her not only
for comfort, but for strength and inspiration and the
doubling of your intellectual and moral powers.
Blot out from your mind any idea of superiority;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
you have none. There is no inequality between man
and woman; but as often is the case between two
men, only different tendencies and special vocations.
Woman and man are the two notes, without which
the human chord cannot be struck." "Marriage," he
wrote to a young wife many years afterwards, "is
sacred, because it is one of the most potent means of
accomplishing life's mission. It gives the almost
superhuman strength that comes of love, the supreme
comfort that makes sacrifice a joy, the dew that
tempers the scorching heat upon the flower." But
"now, as a rule," he says, "we do not love. Love,
the most holy thing that God has given to man, has
become a febrile need, a brutish instinct; the family
is perverted into a denial of all vocation and social
duty; male and female have cancelled man and
woman." He himself was a man, not likely to be
easily in love. His work absorbed his vital force, and
he had no pity for men who forgot public work in
domestic happiness. And though his unsoiled purity
and gentleness, together with the sympathy that
allowed him to understand women as few men can
do, won him the devotion and affection of many
women, especially Englishwomen, the sentiment, on
his side at least, was, save in two cases, one of
"intense friendship" only.</p>

<p>He had two or three boyish passions, one for an
English girl who lived near his home at Genoa, another
for a Genoese, Adele Zoagli, who afterwards became
the mother of the patriot-poet Mameli. When he
went into exile, the only women who had a place in
his heart were his own mother and Madame Ruffini.
His affection for his mother was very serious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
deep, more masculine and less sentimental than in
the common course of Italian filial love. Perhaps
after his boyhood she did not influence him in details,
and intellectually there was some lack of sympathy
between them. But her strong pride in him, that
made her "thank God day and night for having given
her that son," her faith in his political, though not in
his religious beliefs, the love that watched year after
year over the son she saw not, the courage that made
her bear long years of parting rather than ask him to
deny his call, made the most lasting human inspiration
of his life. In time of deep trouble a man will turn
to his mother and his God, and he looked to her, as to
one whose love would never change, to whom he could
pour out, not indeed his spiritual misery, but all the
little material worries which a man tells only to his
mother and his wife, certain that her sympathy would
never fail. His love for Madame Ruffini was of
another kind. She was a very noble woman, with
intense and unconcealed sympathies, wise with the
experience of age and motherhood and sorrow; and
Mazzini was not the only one in the circle of friends
at Genoa, who loved her with the reverential affection,
that an elderly woman of saintly life and understanding
will call forth from young men. It was she, whose
own deep religious faith had saved him in youth from
his short episode of scepticism. Another woman would
have reproached him with Jacopo's death; to her the
common memory of one so dear only fed the affection,
that many memories and the same intense religious,
almost mystical, beliefs had already made so strong.
He calls her "mother, friend, and all that is more
sacred," "the purest, whitest, holiest soul he had ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
met on earth." As far as we can tell, it was from no
fault of his that their friendship closed afterwards in
misunderstanding and silence.</p>

<p>His devotion to these two women had a deeper and
more lasting influence on him than any lover's passion.
There was, however, at least one other, whom he loved
in another way, one to whom he gave his troth and
whom he would have married, had an exile's life
allowed it. Giuditta Sidoli was the daughter of a
noble Lombard family, where she had been brought up
in a school of patriotism. Her brother, Carlo Bellerio,
was a follower of Young Italy, and was banished for
his faith. She had been married, when a mere girl, to
Giovanni Sidoli, a wealthy Reggian, a patriot and an
exile too; and he swore her on his death-bed to be
true to the cause to which he had given his life. She
was one year older than Mazzini, a quiet-moving, gracious
woman, almost beautiful, with a gentle, blonde Venetian
face, warm, golden hair, and dark, thoughtful eyes;
sober and unemotional in her manner, but with deep
springs of enthusiasm and devotion. Mazzini first met
her, a five years' widow, at Marseilles and afterwards
in Switzerland; their liking and common interests
soon deepened into love, and he was engaged to her
before he left France. A few months before the
Savoy Expedition, her yearning for her children, who
were left at Reggio, drove her to Florence in the
hope that with or without the Government's consent
she might see them. Thanks to the Tuscan police,
who opened and copied Mazzini's letters to her,
we have some fragments of their correspondence.
"There are words in your letter," he writes, "which
make me still thrill with joy. In these last days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
I have learnt the strength of my love. I have covered
your lock with kisses. Oh, that I could sleep for once
with my head resting on your knees." To a common
friend he writes, probably a little later, "I love her
more than she thinks, much more than she loves me.
I dream of her day and night, and it becomes more
and more a fixed idea with me; and yet I know with
absolute certainty I shall never live with her, not even
if Italy were free."</p>

<p>Up to a point they doubtless loved; but, especially
when one remembers Mazzini's emotional epistolary
style of this time, one is tempted to question whether
their love had very much passion in it. It was the
tender, strong affection of two absolutely good and
kindred souls, and with neighbourhood it might have
ripened into more. But long separation cooled it,
and neither was inconsolable. To Giuditta probably
at bottom her children were dearer than her lover,
and Mazzini felt this. She seems to have made no
effort to join him afterwards in England; she went to
Parma to be near her children and importune the
ducal brute, who forbade her access to them, at last
going to Reggio in his despite and apparently seeing
them for a moment. Mazzini for his part was wrapped
up in his work and the struggle with exacting poverty.
In England he hardly corresponds with her, partly
because his letters might have brought fresh persecution
on her, but partly, one is forced to conclude,
because there was no lover's ardour to find out a way.
But he still considered himself as in honour bound to
her, and in a sense no doubt he loved her still. He
writes in the summer of 1838, "Giuditta loves me, I
love her, and have promised to love her," but he speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
as if he feared a rupture rather for its effects on her
than on himself. Two years later he writes as if his
love were dead. But, if love was dead, friendship, and
a very strong and true one, remained to the end. It is
probable that they never ceased entirely to correspond.
In the fifties, when she was living in the Valle dei
Salici, near Turin, a grey-haired woman, with all
the gracious gentleness and culture of her earlier
days, Mazzini would come to see her in his secret
visits to Piedmont, and she was still the tolerant but
ardent believer in his policy. When she was on her
death-bed, a year before he died himself, he wrote
"as an old friend" to "one of the best spirits he had
ever met."</p>

<p>In a sense Giuditta had a rival. During his Swiss
wanderings, the daughter of de Mandrot, a friendly
<i>avocat</i> at Lausanne, whom he had met casually,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
became strongly attracted to him. And what was
at first a woman's pity and a disciple's adoration,
changed to passionate love. She was a girl of some
sixteen years, of rich, emotional nature and spiritual
yearnings, that echoed to his own. When he went to
London, and she saw no more of him and heard of
his uncared-for loneliness, her hopeless love and pity
worked on her, till she pined into melancholy and
illness, and her friends begged him to return and save
her by his presence. What response he made to her
love, it is not easy to say. If one may judge from
the meagre references in his letters, he felt at first
no more than affectionate gratitude for the rich gift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
he could not take. But later, as he learnt more
of her constancy and unhappiness, and his love for
Giuditta wore away, and he ached for a woman's
loving hand, his affection ripened into something that
was probably nearer passionate love than anything he
felt before or after. Not that his permanent, reasoning
self was disloyal to Giuditta. "Am I free?" he
writes to a friend, who would gladly have seen him
and the girl united; "before society and men, who
recognise only actual bonds, I am; but before my
own heart and God, who watches over promises, I am
not." Sometimes indeed he balanced the results to
the two women, and was tempted for the moment
to think that "the imperious duty" of saving the one
from death or life-long misery might justify the breaking
of his promise to Giuditta. But he knew that it
would be a cruel blow to the woman to whom he had
pledged himself; he felt he would gladly escape from
an attachment, which stained his loyalty to her; and
his common sense told him that his gloomy companionship
and the privations of an exile's life would
never make a young girl permanently happy. And
so he never seriously faltered in crushing down the
rising love within him or trying to crush it out in
her. He steadily declines to admit more than a
brother-and-sisterly relationship; he prays she may
forget him and begs his friends to do their best to
kill her love by painting him in his defects; he
refuses to correspond with her, and though at last
at the earnest prayer of her friends he promises to
come, if he can find the money, it was only to save
her from the pining that was bringing her to her
grave. But though he put her aside as a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and impossible dream, he could not stop the yearning.
"Do you think," he writes, "that I easily give
up having near me one like her, a creature of God,
young, pure, religious, enthusiastic, into whose heart I
could pour all the world of feelings and dreams and
beliefs and love that is in me?" He finds his comfort
in the thought that theirs is "a mystical, spiritual
union," that she will meet and make him happy in
another world. In this world he never saw her again,
and it seems that her passion soon fretted her frail
life away. Love of wife and love of family were not
for him, and bitterly he felt it. "He, who through
fatality of circumstances," he wrote long after, "cannot
live the serene life of family, has a void in his heart,
that nothing fills; and I who write these pages, well
I know it."</p>

</p>

<p>Early in 1837 Mazzini and the Ruffinis came to
London. The determining cause was the inability of
the latter to bear the privations of a life of hiding.
They travelled by slow diligence stages through
France, the French government, which was only glad
to get them out of Switzerland, giving them every
facility for the journey. In London at all events they
were free men, able to live under their own names
and move where they liked, untroubled by the police.
But the change from the snows and sunsets and
silences of Switzerland to the squalor and noise of a
back street in London added to Mazzini's desolation.
In this "sunless and musicless island," with the
dreary stretches of houses and the wearing din, he
pined for the peace of the Alps, where nature had
brought him an occasional respite from his heart-ache.
"We have lost," he writes, "even the sky, which the
veriest wretch on the Continent can look at"; and in
time the desolate walls across the street worried him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
till he would not go to the window. The one thing
in London that appealed to him was the fog. "When
you look up, the eye loses itself in a reddish, bell-shaped
vault, which always gives me, I don't know
why, an idea of the phosphorescent light of the
Inferno.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The whole city seems under a kind of
spell, and reminds me of the Witches' Scene in
Macbeth or the Brocksberg or the Witch of Endor.
The passers-by look like ghosts,&mdash;one feels almost a
ghost oneself." The half-glimpses of the buildings,
harmonising with their sombre colouring, gave him a
sense of mystery and indefiniteness, that redeemed
London of "the positive and finite" of a Southern
town, and responded to his growing faith in the
poetic and unseen.</p>

<p>For a few weeks he lived at 24 Goodge Street,
Tottenham Court Road, with the Ruffinis and two
other exiles, who had helped him in the Marseilles
days. In March the quintet moved to 9 George
Street, near the Euston Road, where they suffered
many things from the maid-of-all-work, who no doubt
did much as she liked with the five inexperienced
males, only two of whom could speak English at all
well. Here they lived for three years, on the whole a
very miserable household. Mazzini himself was "an
angel of kindness and good-temper and enthusiasm,"
ever ready to sacrifice himself to others' whims and
comforts. But the unhappy mystic was no cheerful
companion, he was unpractical and dogmatic, probably
sometimes peevish, half-lost in the empyrean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of his ideals, beyond the ken or sympathy of the
others. Agostino Ruffini's petty selfishness and
ungovernable tongue were the source of frequent
scenes, which one day brought Mazzini to tears, "tears
which nothing else could have drawn from him,"
as he writes plaintively to Agostino's mother. At
bottom young Ruffini recognized Mazzini's worth and
devotedness, and swore himself on paper to keep his
temper, with other salutary resolutions, to be read
over three times a week; but he was quite incapable
of reaching to Mazzini's mind, and he longed to
enjoy himself in a freer life, where the gospel of
duty was never heard. Giovanni was more equable,
and knew Mazzini better, but he too had small belief
in the gospel, and there was little except old associations
and the common love of his mother to bind
him to his transcendental friend. The general
irresponsiveness at home bitterly hurt and saddened
Mazzini. "I love no one and want to love no one,"
he writes of his English surroundings; and in his
letters to his friends in Italy and Switzerland, he
returns again and again to the lack of sympathy
around him, as the heaviest trial of those unhappy days.</p>

<p>There was nothing to distract him from the sordidness
of the bickering household in George Street.
He seldom went out of doors, except to the British
Museum. He had no money to buy books and complains
that nobody would lend them. He saw few
besides a few exiles, as poor and perhaps as unhappy
as himself. He was "lost in a vast crowd of strangers,
in a country where want, especially in a foreigner, is
a reason for a distrust, which is often unjust and
sometimes cruel." In common with his companions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he was miserably poor, often living on potatoes or
rice. His father advanced him money to speculate
in olive oil; naturally he lost it, and after an angry
letter from the hard old man, refused for several years
to accept help from home. He tried to find employment
as a proof-reader, but in vain. He had an offer
of work at Edinburgh, but the Ruffinis would not
leave London, and he felt himself tied to them.
Literary work came in very slowly, and for a year or
two his articles in the English reviews brought in little
profit, when the translator had been paid. The
income of the rest of the household was not much
larger, and the bad house-keepers found that in England
"francs were little better than sous." Mazzini, as
ever, could not shut his purse to the needy exiles,
who importuned him and, as Agostino grumbled, "in
the name of this chimera of human brotherhood
thought they had a right to make themselves at home
in his house." His few possessions soon found their
way to the pawn-shop. He pledged his mother's
ring, his watch and books and maps; his cloak went
to buy cigars, "the one thing I don't think I can do
without." On one black Saturday he pawned a pair
of boots and an old waistcoat to find food for the
Sunday. One winter he risked his health by giving
away his only overcoat. His mother, finding that
good clothes got sold at once to buy suits for his
friends, thought it better to send several suits of
cheaper garments, so that he could keep one at least
for himself. Sometimes his wardrobe was so depleted,
that he had to stay at home, and could not go to the
British Museum to carry on his literary work. His
generosity was well-known to his better-off friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and it is not surprising that their patience in lending
him money was exhausted. He tried a few years
later to negotiate a loan on the security of yet unwritten
manuscripts; but the ingenuous scheme met
with no better success. Once some friends at Paris
lent him £120; another by a ruse persuaded him to
accept what was practically a gift;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but when towards
the end of his first residence in England a proposal
was made at Turin to raise a subscription for him, he
obstinately declined it, partly because, if it reached his
mother's ears, she "would have died of shame." There
were thus only two roads open to him, suicide or the
money-lenders. The thought of suicide came to him
again and again, but he put it away as a coward's act
and for his mother's sake. So more and more he fell
into the money-lenders' hands, borrowing at thirty or
forty or sometimes nearly one hundred per cent. from
loan societies, that "rob the poor man of his last drop
of blood and sometimes his last rags of self-respect."
Year after year he plunged desperately in the morass,
and though £320 seems to have been the limit of his
indebtedness, it was a crushing sum for one so utterly
destitute. It was the common lot of the exiles, and
some of them fared worse. In the midst of wealthy
London, with men of means all round them, who
shared their political views and made speeches for
their cause, Karl Stolzmann, the Polish leader, one of
Mazzini's nearest friends, went sometimes literally
without food, and Stanislaus Worcell, born a rich
Polish noble, was saved from a pauper's burial by an
English acquaintance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Apart, however, from money troubles, Mazzini's
external life gradually brightened. In 1840, after a
short stay at 26 Clarendon Square, not far from their
George Street house, where happily Agostino left them
for work in Edinburgh, he and Giovanni moved to
4 York Buildings, which then stood in the angle
between King's Road, Chelsea, and Riley Street. He
came there to be near the Carlyles, and escape from
London gloom and noise and importunate visitors.
An Italian artisan, an exile from Perugia, kept house
with his English wife, who proved an excellent housekeeper
and saved them from servant-girl worries. In
those days there was a hay-field on one side of the
house and market-gardens on another, some trees in
view "of a very sombre green, but still trees," and not
far off the Thames, "equally sombre with its muddy
dirty-yellow water, but beautiful at night, when its
colour is lost in the dark, and the water shines silver
in the moonlight, and the barges go down, black,
silent, mysterious as ghosts." After a year Giovanni
left him after a violent quarrel, and went to Paris.
They were never really reconciled again, and Giovanni
repaid his friend's devotion with a coldness and contempt
almost as unworthy as his brother's, though he
did something to atone for it by the sympathetic
picture of his old comrade as the Fantasio of his
<i>Lorenzo Benoni</i>.</p>

<p>Uncomfortable as his relations with them had been,
Mazzini felt the loss of the Ruffinis. With them or
without them, the early years of his English life were,
if anything, more utterly forlorn and miserable than
his worst days in Switzerland. His intellect, indeed,
was safe now, though there are indications still of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
mental weariness and strain, that bordered on hallucination.
There was no longer any fear of a spiritual
collapse, like that which had threatened a year or
two ago to wreck his moral faith. But he was more
wedded to his misery, more desolate, alone in "the
solitude of a damned soul." "A man cannot live
alone," he writes, "and I have nobody who cares to
know what I am thinking of and what I want." His
heart sank, when he came home from the British
Museum to his bare, dark room, where there was no
friend or woman to welcome him, and Agostino's
querulous temper to add to the loneliness of it all.
More and more the want of response around him
made him seal up his thoughts and aspirations. His
friends' ingratitude, the desertion of his followers
added to the "terrors" of his spiritual solitude. It
seemed to him "an age of moral dissolution and
unbelief, an age like that in which Christ died."
The sense of failure still lay heavy on him, a brooding,
unhealthy feeling that his work had been in vain,
that it was his doom to bring ill-fortune to his friends,
that he had sacrificed himself and made no one happier
by it. He felt like "one irrevocably condemned,
though without fault." "Pray for me," he writes to
one of his best friends, "that, before I die, I may be
good for something."</p>

<p>Two things saved him from despair, perhaps from
suicide. In the crisis in Switzerland he had put away,
once for all, any thought of personal happiness.
Sometimes still the natural man rebelled. "Do you
think," he writes of Madeleine, "that in my hours of
desolation I would not, if I could, seek a breast on
which to lay my brow, a loving hand to place upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
my head." But he knew that to look for happiness
led imperceptibly but certainly to selfishness, that
"sacrifice was the one real virtue," that duty "to God,
and humanity, and country, and all men" was the only
law of life for the true man. And what he had
worked out once in cold philosophy, now mellowed
into religion, mystical sometimes, but beautiful and
saving. Jacopo Ruffini and his own dead sister were
praying for him, watching over him, inspiring him with
strength and love. Life was an expiation, to purify
the soul for another stage, where friends would meet
again, and misunderstandings pass, and love reign
over all. And even in this world, though sorrow
might be the portion of the individual man, Humanity,
the great collective being, would go ever forward to
new knowledge, and new hopes, and nobler rules of
life.</p>

<p>Perhaps, even more than by his faith, he was saved
by his intense affections. True that they centred on
ever fewer persons. He had hardly a real friend left
among his old political associates. For the men and
women, whom he was coming to know in England, he
felt as yet gratitude but little more. His love for
Giuditta Sidoli was fading into a sincere but unpassionate
esteem. Madeleine was an impossible
dream, that he resolutely shook away. But the
dear ones of his boyhood,&mdash;Madame Ruffini, his
mother, his unmarried sister, even his dour father,&mdash;were
loved with an affection that was pitifully, almost
morbidly sad, but ever more intense. It was the only
sunshine in his clouded life. "I feel God's power and
law more every day," he wrote to Madame Ruffini,
"but He cannot weep with me or fill my soul's void
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
for I am a man still and tied to earth. I worship
Him more than I love Him, but you I love." And
he pours out, in words that read extravagant but came
in truth from his inmost being, all that reverential
love, which he felt for her, who had been more than
mother, but whose affection for her devotee was
cooling all too quickly. Agostino did his best to
damage his friend in her eyes; there seems to have
been friction between her and Madame Mazzini; and
no doubt she sided with her own sons, when the
estrangement with them came. At the beginning of
1841 Mazzini's correspondence with her appears to
have abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>To his parents he turned yearningly in a new
sorrow, that was bowing them down. His one surviving
unmarried sister died. She had been his favourite,
the one of the family who had sympathized most with
his political schemes, and encouraged him in his work,
and pleaded for him with his father. Her death
obsessed him with an unhealthy depression; but he
felt most for his parents, left in the solitude of old
age, bereft of the one who had been a needed link
between them, for the father had grown morose, and
there was evidently some want of harmony between
the old people. Then the father himself fell very ill
and recovered with difficulty. His son brooded over
the thought that he had not been enough to his
parents while he was with them, that the life he had
chosen for himself had been the cause of all their
trouble. Plans for their comfort worked in his mind
"like a never-resting wheel." He would have risked
the death-sentence that still hung over him, and gone to
live with them in hiding, but he knew that the dread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of discovery would only have added to their cares. It
seems indeed that in 1844 he paid a visit to them in
disguise.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The gloom lifted somewhat, as he began to make
friends in England. He was not yet, it is true, in
sympathy with English life. He found little liking
here for his transcendentalisms, his big indeterminate
generalizations; and English love of facts and
suspicion of theories seemed to him "materialism
incarnate, pure critical analysis," fatal to spiritual or
philosophic thought. "Here," he writes, "everybody
is a sectarian or a materialist"; and now, as always,
he never understood or valued Protestantism. He
had a poor opinion of English statesmen, especially
of the Whigs, who irritated him by the folly of their
attempts to put down Chartism. Nor did he think
much better of the Chartist leaders, who were
"Englishmen, which means materialists, utilitarians,
Benthamists <i>par excellence</i>, with no principle except
that of the greatest possible happiness." The severance
between the middle and working classes
portended, he thought, an imminent and terrible
revolution. But he came by degrees to recognize
the better side of English life. He admired its
tolerance, its insistency and tenacity, the "unity of
thought and action, which never rests till it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
carried each new social idea into practice, and when
it has taken a step, never retraces it." He watched
the Chartist movement sympathetically, and contrasted
its great following with the scanty disciples
of the French socialists. Though he cared little for
its doctrines, he saw in it something that rose above
"the narrow egotism, which characterizes English
politics," and he especially approved, when the
Chartists put aside national prejudices and sent their
good wishes to the Canadian rebels.</p>

<p>Gradually he came to feel more at home in
England. "There," he says, "friendships develop
slowly and with difficulty, but nowhere are they so
sincere and lasting." "Never," he wrote in after
days, "shall I forget, never without a throb of
gratitude shall I mention the land, which became
a kind of second country to me, where I found
friendships that brought an enduring balm to my
weary and unhappy life." After a year or two his
circle widened almost too rapidly, for clothes and bus
fares and the drain upon his time made society an
expensive matter to him. One of the first English persons
who took an interest in him, was Mrs Archibald
Fletcher of Edinburgh. A few months after he
came to England, she met him, "a young, slim, dark
man of very prepossessing appearance," who could
not speak English and wanted admission to a public
library. So profoundly unhappy he seemed, that the
kind old lady feared suicide and wrote to gently warn
him. Mazzini replied that no one but "a man, who
wished only to enjoy and has made that his chief
thought, will destroy his life as a child does its play-thing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>His first close English friendship was with the
Carlyles. "They love me as a brother," he wrote
in 1840, "and would like to do me more good than
it is in their power to do." For Carlyle he had for
several years a very sincere liking. "He is good,
good, good; and still, I think, in spite of his great
reputation, unhappy." He respected Carlyle's sincerity,
his freedom from insular narrowness, his outspokenness.
"He may preach the merit of 'holding one's tongue';&mdash;to
those, in truth, who do not agree with him, are
such words addressed,&mdash;but 'the talent of silence' is
not his." He welcomed him as one "who served the
same God" as himself, "though with a different
worship"; his ally in the attack on utilitarianism,
in the exaltation of the spiritual. "His motive is
the love of his fellow-men, a deep and active feeling
of duty, for he believes this to be the mission of
man on earth." Their common love of Dante, no
doubt, too, helped to draw them together. But in his
criticisms of his books he condemned, however gently
and respectfully, his individualism, his hero-worship,
his depreciation of the great common march of the
race, his ineffectiveness and timidity, when he came
to practical political applications. And the antagonism
grew on him, till in time they seemed to be "diametrically
opposed." "Why," he said long afterwards to a
girl, who had been reading and admiring Carlyle, "you
are fast drifting down the road to materialism. You
are lost. Carlyle worships force, I combat it with all
my might. Carlyle is the sceptic of sceptics. He is
grand, when he pulls down, but incapable of reconstructing
something [anything] fresh. If instead of
loving and admiring nations and humanity, you only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
love, admire, and reverence individuals, you must end
by being an advocate of despots." Carlyle on his side
had little sympathy with Mazzini's opinions, which to
him were "incredible and (at once tragically and
comically) impossible in this world." He was impatient
with his "Republicanisms, his 'Progress' and
other Rousseau fanaticisms."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He valued him none
the less for "a most valiant, faithful, considerably
gifted and noble soul." Once the Piedmontese
minister spoke lightly of Mazzini in his presence.
"Sir, you do not know Mazzini at all, not at all,
not at all," Carlyle angrily replied and left the
house. At the time of the Bandiera episode, though
they had recently been quarrelling, he wrote to the
<i>Times</i>, "Whatever I may think of his practical insight
and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great freedom
testify to all men, that he, if I have ever seen such,
is a man of genius and virtue, a man of sterling
veracity, humanity, and nobleness of mind, one of
those rare men, numerable unfortunately but as units
in this world, who are worthy to be called martyr
souls; who in silence, piously in their daily life,
understand and practise what is meant by that."
Mazzini, mindful of their late coolness, was much
touched by the defence. "That I call noble," he
said of it to a friend.</p>

<p>For Mrs Carlyle Mazzini had a warmer feeling; and
she reciprocated it not only with an intense personal
confidence, but for a time at all events by sharing
his political beliefs. Gradually she came more to her
husband's view of these; and Mazzini and she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
"warm dialogues," when he unfolded some wild
design of throwing away his life in Italy. "Are
there not things more important than my head?" he
asked her. "Certainly," she replied, "but the man,
who has not sense enough to keep his head on his
shoulders till something is to be gained by parting
from it, has not sense enough to manage any important
matter." But "to the last," says Carlyle, "she had
always an affection for him"; in 1846 she came to
him for advice on her troubled married life, and he
appeals to her to "send her ghosts and phantoms back
to nothingness" and make it bearable by communion
with her dead parents and work and love. "Get up
and work. When the Evil One wanted to tempt
Jesus, he led Him into a solitude."</p>

<p>Mazzini was a frequent caller at their house;
coming in all weathers, "his doe-skin boots oozing
out water in a manner frightful to behold" upon her
carpets. Sometimes he would come with any story
that he could think of to amuse her; sometimes he
would discuss Dante with John Carlyle, who was then
writing his translation of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, till
Carlyle grew weary of the talk and reminded both
that the last bus was starting. Margaret Fuller has
left a description of an evening spent with the trio;
how Mazzini turned the conversation "to progress and
ideal subjects, and Carlyle was fluent in invectives on
all our 'rose-water imbecilities,'" how his flippancy
saddened Mazzini, and Mrs Carlyle said to Margaret,
"these are but opinions to Carlyle, but to Mazzini,
who has given his all and helped bring his friends
to the scaffold in pursuit of such subjects, it is a
matter of life and death." On another occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Carlyle, after monopolizing the talk while he passed
in long review the silent great ones of earth, turned
to Mazzini, saying, "You have not succeeded yet,
because you have talked too much." The contests
between them became more frequent and painful.
They would argue, so the tradition has been handed
down, the one courteous, deeply moved, pleading
with his whole heart, eloquent in his rather broken
English; the other exaggerative, splenetic, scornful in
the wild flow of his language. All the time Mazzini
would sit pale and quiet in his chair, sometimes excited
almost to tears, nervously smoking his small cigar;
while Carlyle with his long clay pipe shifted restlessly,
as he stormed out his sentences.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> None the less
Mazzini's intimacy with them went on unbroken, at
all events as far as Mrs Carlyle was concerned, through
all his first stay in England. When he left for Milan
in 1848, he told her with a kiss to be "strong and
good until he returned"; and when he came back
aged and worn, she sadly stroked his grey beard.
She found lodgings for him; she went to comfort him,
when prostrated by his mother's death. But the
severance between him and her husband gradually
widened, till two or three years later they completely
parted, to respect each other's character and detest
each other's opinions to the end. Once more they
met, years afterwards, and "talked in a cordial and
sincere way with real emotion on both sides."
"Mazzini," Carlyle noted at the time, "is the most
<i>pious</i> living man I now know." Even for his politics
he had at last some tolerance. "The idealist has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
conquered," he confessed, "and transformed his utopia
into a patent and potent reality."</p>

<p>With the Carlyles, however, even in the days of his
closest acquaintanceship, he was never at home as he
came to be in other English households. His best
friends in the forties were the Ashursts of Muswell
Hill. They were, he says, "a dear, good, holy family,
who surrounded me with such loving care as sometimes
to make me forget I was an exile." W. H.
Ashurst was a solicitor, who had been a friend of
Robert Owen, and who made Mazzini's acquaintance
at the time of the letter-opening episode. To Mrs
Ashurst Mazzini, forgetful of Madame Ruffini's expired
title, gave the name of "second mother." One daughter
married James Stansfeld; the other, at this time "the
favourite of his English sisters," afterwards became
Madame Venturi, and has left the best English
memoir of him. Both they and their brother for
long years after gave him much quiet help in his
work. Through the Ashursts he came to know the
Stansfelds and Peter Taylors, but his intimate friendship
with them belongs rather to the time of his
second residence in England. Among his other friends
were William Shaen, whom the Italian refugees knew
as their <i>angelo salvatore</i>, Joseph Toynbee, the father
of Arnold Toynbee, Joseph Cowen, afterwards member
for Newcastle, and George Jacob Holyoake. J. S. Mill
wrote of him as "one of the men he most respected."
Margaret Fuller, who had come to England prepossessed
against him, lost her prejudices when she visited his
school for organ-boys, and began the friendship which
was to be renewed in the days of the Roman Republic.
"She is," he writes of her to a friend, "one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
rarest of women in her love and active sympathy with
everything that is great, beautiful, and holy." He
had some intercourse with the two, next to himself,
most notable Italian exiles in London at that time,
Gabriel Rossetti and Antonio Panizzi. Mazzini
interested Rossetti in his school, and they had
common acquaintances among the exiles; but they
never came into close touch, and Mazzini tried in
vain to persuade him to help in his patriotic work.
At a later date political differences completely
sundered them. Panizzi was already Keeper of
Printed Books at the British Museum. He had
been a Carbonaro in his Italian days, and he and
Mazzini had common ground in their cult of Dante
and Foscolo. He backed Mazzini warmly in the
incident of the letter-opening a few years later; but
they disagreed on Italian politics, and they saw little
of one another, though they seem to have been never
entirely estranged. Among other foreigners that he
met were Prince Napoleon ("Plon-Plon"), then busily
conspiring against the Orleanists, and Conneau, afterwards
Louis Napoleon's doctor and a general go-between
for the Emperor and the Italian patriots.
But he hated anything that tasted of fashionable
society. The mistress of a famous London salon
once persuaded him to come to her house, but when
he found that she wanted him to adorn her society
and not from any interest in his cause, he refused to
go again.</p>

<p>He came at this time much under the influence of
Lamennais. They began to correspond soon after
the <i>Words of a Believer</i> were published, and once at
least they met. Mazzini saw a kindred soul in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
"priest of the Church Universal," who "preached God,
the people, love, and liberty"; this man "whom I saw
but lately," so he writes in 1839, "so full of sweetness
and love, who weeps like a child at a symphony of
Beethoven, who will give his last franc to the poor,
who tends flowers like a woman, and steps out of his
path rather than crush an ant." He recognised how
much Lamennais' teaching had in common with his
own in its reaction against the sceptical, destructive
school of the Revolution, in its belief in tradition and
humanity, in its appeal to duty as the principle of life.
In some degree, perhaps, Lamennais' <i>Words of a
Believer</i> inspired his own <i>Duties of Man</i>. He had his
own plans for him. He saw in him "a Luther of the
nineteenth century"; he hoped, though not very
confidently, that he would come frankly forward as a
teacher of the religion of humanity, and he urged him
to "do something better than write books," and become
the missionary of the new faith. Lamennais
replied, that though Christ could preach in the highways,
four persons could not meet now in a field to
speak of God and humanity without being taken up by
a policeman. Mazzini was grievously disappointed
at the refusal, and he felt that Lamennais regarded
him with some diffidence, as indeed was natural
enough. He "loved him as a friend and revered him
as a saint"; but he felt that Lamennais returned his
love "as it were in spite of himself." "This good
Mazzini, one cannot help loving him," Lamennais
once said in his hearing; and the phrase left an unhappy
sense in Mazzini's mind.</p>

<p>Lamennais and "George Sand" were in his judgment
"the two first living writers of France" at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
time, and he looked to the latter too as one of his
own faith. At the time of his mental crisis in
Switzerland he read her <i>Lettres d'un Voyageur</i> (he
always thought it her best production), and the book
was "sweet to him as is the cradle song to a weeping
child." He corresponded with her, and in 1847
visited her in the Vallée Noire. She impressed him
above all, as she did Matthew Arnold the year before,
by her simplicity. "Madame Sand," he wrote
back to England, "is just as we wanted her to be;
good, noble, candid, simple, calmly suffering, even
more than can be seen in her books." He warmly
defended her in England; not that he thought that
all her books were to be lightly put into everybody's
hand; but "the evil she has portrayed is not <i>her</i>
evil, it is ours," and her realism was informed by
a passionate moral purpose. Genius, he said, can
in the long-run do nothing but good, and it is
bound to make itself heard. "You may sound
your alarm against her in your old <i>Quarterly</i>, and
forbid your youth to read her: you will find some
day, without well knowing how, the best places in
your library usurped by her volumes." He saw in
her "an apostle of religious democracy"; he responded
to her sense of the Divine, her belief that
the decay of the old creeds restored allegiance to
the true Godhead, her faith in a future which should
be built on love. He delighted to repeat her words,
"there is but one virtue, the eternal sacrifice of self."
And he saw in her, too, the voice of down-trodden
womanhood; "thank God," he says, "she is a
woman," and her books were a revelation of the
"inward life of woman," a woman's pleading for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
justice and equality. At this time few writers
appealed to him more; but her later works and
her acceptance of the Empire alienated him, and
afterwards he "sadly and unwillingly" convinced
himself that what he had hailed as the sincere
and conscious "utterance of a high priestess," was
but the artist's passive echo of a faith that was not
hers.</p>

<p class="p2">Slowly, besides making friends, Mazzini began to
find work. The difficulties were great. He was at first
too worn-out and unhappy to care to write. He could
not yet write in English, and the expenses of translation
absorbed a large part of the remuneration. It
was a painful effort to trim his pen to the likings of
the English public. "My ideas and style frighten
them," he says. "What is old to us is new to them.
One cannot talk to them of mission or humanity or
progress or socialism." One editor refused an article
in praise of Byron, "because Byron was an immoral
poet." Kemble, the editor of the <i>British and Foreign
Review</i>, politely declined his articles, after some experience
of them, on the ground that the English
public were "conceited asses," who could only gradually
be broken in to listen to generalizations. Mazzini
sometimes promised to do his best, but the effort came
unwillingly, and it was only the pressing need of
money and his resolve to ask no more from home,
that made him write in an alien style on subjects that
often had little interest for him. To an English
reader, however, the discipline appears a salutary one;
and his English articles have a precision of thought
that his earlier writings lacked. His literary out-put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
was considerable. Some of his articles were more or
less pot-boiling; thus he wrote on Fra Paolo Sarpi
in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, on Victor Hugo and
Lamartine&mdash;brilliant and suggestive essays&mdash;in the
<i>British and Foreign Review</i>, on contemporary French
literature in the <i>Monthly Chronicle</i>. He put more
heart into those on English subjects,&mdash;his masterly
criticisms of Carlyle in the <i>British and Foreign Review</i>
and the <i>Monthly Chronicle</i>, and his papers on Chartism
in <i>Tait's Edinburgh Journal</i>. But what he cared for
most was to bring Italy or his own religious faith
before English readers. He wrote for the love of it,
when he discoursed on Dante's Minor Works in the
<i>Foreign Quarterly</i> and on Lamennais in the <i>Monthly
Chronicle</i>, or when he wrote on Italian politics for the
same magazine, and on recent Italian literature, and
probably on Italian art, for the <i>Westminster Review</i>.
In the <i>People's Journal</i> under John Saunders' editorship
he began the <i>Thoughts on Democracy in Europe</i>,
which were afterwards expanded into <i>I sistemi e la
democrazia</i>,&mdash;a very able criticism of the utilitarian
and earlier socialist schools; in his own <i>Apostolato
Popolare</i> he wrote the first six chapters of the noblest
of all his writings, <i>The Duties of Man</i>. He seems to
have written a novel, which never saw the light.</p>

<p>He found one literary task very near his heart.
From the days of his early studies at Genoa, he had
had a supreme admiration for Ugo Foscolo, as the
one modern Italian writer, besides Alfieri, who had a
virile political teaching for his countrymen. While in
Switzerland, he had planned to write his life, and
made researches for his manuscripts and rare and
scattered publications. His interest strengthened, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
that he was living close to where Foscolo's bones lay
in Chiswick churchyard. He knew that Pickering,
one of Foscolo's English publishers, possessed the
manuscript of his unfinished notes on the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, already published, but with many inaccuracies,
in 1825; and in a dusty corner of Pickering's
shop he found the proof of part of Foscolo's <i>Lettera
apologetica</i>, a kind of political testament, which apparently
had not been published. Mazzini undertook
the task of getting both re-published with more zeal
than candour. Pickering would not sell the <i>Lettera</i>
apart from the Dante manuscript, and asked £420 for
the two. Mazzini "cursed his bookseller soul, and
would have stolen them without scruple, if he could."
A Tuscan lady, Foscolo's <i>donna gentile</i>, lent the
money for the proofs; and Rolandi, the Italian
publisher in Berners Street, was disposed to buy the
Dante notes. Mazzini found that the notes were very
incomplete, and feared that Rolandi would not buy, if
aware of the deficiencies. He concealed the fact, and
with immense labour completed the notes and the
revision of the text. Rolandi, who, it seems, did not
discover the pious fraud, bought the manuscript, and
in 1842 published the edition in four volumes with an
anonymous introduction by Mazzini, who took no pay
for his known and unknown labours. The edition
had its value at the time, though its interest now is
historical only. Meanwhile he discovered the remaining
manuscript of the <i>Lettera apologetica</i> in an old
trunkful of Foscolo's papers; and thanks mainly to
his friend, Enrico Mayer, the educationalist, this and
others of Foscolo's political writings were published at
Lugano in 1844. Mazzini gave much assistance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Le Monnier, the Florentine publisher, in the complete
edition of Foscolo, which he brought out a few years
later. But the life remained undone. For years with
the true student's fever he hunted up every letter and
record of Foscolo, to which he could find a clue. But
as time went on, politics and social work commanded
him again, and the biography, on which so many cares
had been spent, was never written.</p>

<p class="p2">Gradually he returned to political work. At first
the moral prostration produced intense lassitude; and
he found it as difficult to settle down to politics as to
literature. There were moments indeed of nervous
reaction, when his brain teemed with "daring projects,
titanic presentiments, limitless conceptions." But
generally the struggle with depression used up his
strength, and he felt too weary and discouraged to
revive Young Italy. He seems, a few months before
he left Switzerland, to have taken some sort of formal
step to abdicate leadership. But where no actual
organization survived, and there was no one to step
into his place, the retirement meant nothing. Young
Italy was so completely himself, that the society was
non-existent, till he took up the reins again. There
had been something of a stampede among its members.
In Italy many had made their peace with the governments;
others were nourishing their faith in silence;
few carried on the work, at least in the old spirit.
Conspiracy, it is true, was not quite dead; but the
few secret societies, that still lived on, mostly harked
back to Carbonaro traditions, or turned to an agrarian
and free-thinking agitation, which was as hateful to
Mazzini as apostacy itself. It was no better among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the exiles. "There are not two of us," he complained,
"who think the same on any single subject." "You
cannot find one Young Italian among us." Many
took advantage of the Lombard and Piedmontese
amnesties to return home. Gioberti was attacking
the society. Even those nearest to Mazzini had little
faith in its methods or hopes, and Mazzini would
compromise on no tittle of his creed to win them.
In his high singleness of purpose he could not understand
or tolerate the faintness of men, who had sworn
to fight for an idea, but deserted at the first defeat.
If his countrymen had not responded, that was only
an argument for renewed and yet more strenuous
effort. It was all so pitiful to him,&mdash;this want of
faithfulness unto death. "When I write in favour
of Italy," he says, "I feel myself blush, as if I were
lying." For a time, though, he himself felt powerless
to act. He was tempted to go to Italy, and throw
away his life in some desperate act of protest. But
he had too fine a nature to be long content with
inaction or despair. "If you only knew," he writes
early in 1839, "how this absolute uselessness of existence
weighs on me." He dreaded dying with his work
undone. Jacopo Ruffini's memory was ever present
with him, and he felt that he was dedicated to the
cause for which his protomartyr had died. He had
taken on himself a task "in the face of God and Italy
and himself"; he thought of himself as blasphemer
and hypocrite, if he slackened in it; and though he
knew that his enthusiasm had gone, sometimes too his
confidence in Italy and himself, yet duty still remained,
and he could trust in God and the righteousness of
his cause. "I know," he wrote, "that Jacopo is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
dead, that he and we are forerunners, not of a new
policy, but of a new faith, which we perhaps shall see
not, but whose advent no human force can stop."</p>

<p>It was not however till the summer or autumn of
1839,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that he decided to return to active political
work "with an almost fierce resolve." At first he had
no definite plan, except to accentuate the popular side
of his programme and appeal more than he had yet
done to the working classes. He had at present little
means of reaching those at home, but he could do
something among the Italian population in London,
the shopkeepers and organ-grinders and hawkers of
terra-cotta casts. Hitherto he had been little in
contact with his working-class compatriots; now in
the whirl of a foreign city he came to know them. It
began with his intense feeling for suffering, that for
the remainder of his life made him happiest when
relieving individual cases of misery. About this time,
going out one winter morning, he found a young girl
on the doorstep worn out with cold and hunger.
With the sympathy for forlorn womanhood, which he
had in common with the greatest of English statesmen,
he took her in and put her in his landlady's
charge. When the girl afterwards married, and was
deserted by her husband, he undertook the education
of her children, and for many years devoted to it a
large share of his scanty income. The same charity
now drew him to the waifs of his own land. Talking
to the Italian organ-boys, who went about the streets
of London with a barrel-organ and its squirrel or white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
rat, speaking a patois half Comasque half English,
he learnt the details of the "white-slave traffic," how
a few Italians living in London brought over poor
peasant-boys under contracts, which promised high
pay and good living, but which had no validity in
England; how when the boys got there, they were
beaten and half-starved and cowed. He brought the
worst offenders to justice, and did something to
frighten the masters into better treatment of their
victims. But he cared more to influence the boys
themselves. In 1841 he opened a school at 5
Hatton Garden (afterwards removed to 5 Greville
Street, Leather Lane), where the boys came in the
late evenings to learn the three Rs and some elementary
science, and on Sundays had lessons in drawing
and Italian history. The school was very dear to
Mazzini, and the boys, says an English observer,
"revered him as a god and loved him as a father."
One of them, returning to Italy, travelled to Genoa
expressly to tell Madame Mazzini what her son had
done for him. Italian and English friends (Joseph
Toynbee among them) taught gratuitously, and the
annual supper was a great event for him and his
circle. Mario and Grisi sang at concerts to help
the school's finances. The school flourished in spite
of the noisy opposition of a neighbouring Italian priest,&mdash;an
opposition, which Mazzini repaid by his first
angry attack on the Papacy.</p>

<p>Already, before the school was opened, he had
started a political society for the Italian workmen in
London, and was publishing a paper, the <i>Apostolato
Popolare</i>, which came out at intervals till 1843. In
it he makes his appeal to the working-men of Italy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
He felt more strongly even than in his Marseilles
days that a revolutionary movement must depend for
its main support on the working classes and have
their good for its ultimate goal. English life had
brought him into touch with the social thought of the
time, and he felt that political movements were
dwarfing beside the question of the condition of the
masses. He began to speak of the Italy to-be as the
"Italy of the People." It was the people, he wrote,
who suffered most from her dismemberment and
misrule. While other classes had their compensations,
there were no distractions for the unknown
poor, no true home life, no intellectual interest. He
tried to rouse them from their provincialism, their
self-absorbed indifference to politics. He appealed to
them to be patriots and republicans, proud of their
country's glorious past, working for its future and
their children, and remember that God would judge
them not by what wages they earned but by what
they had done for their fellows. But however much
he laid stress on the democratic side of his agitation,
on working-class organization and social reform, he
was careful to safeguard Young Italy from becoming
a class movement. It was at this time and in his
papers for working men, that he first began the
crusade against socialism, which he continued, sometimes
with less discernment, to the end of life.</p>

<p>While Mazzini was watching from England in discouragement,
and the waves seemed to gain no
painful inch, in Italy the main came flooding in.
How far exactly the sudden tide of national impulse
owed itself to his teaching, is perhaps an insoluble
problem. But when one remembers how wide had
been the influence of Young Italy, how many of the
men who were now coming to the front had been its
members, it seems unlikely that the impetus could
have come without him. Young University men
who treasured secretly at home his pamphlets or
numbers of the <i>Apostolato Popolare</i>, artisans who had
fingermarked his or Gustavo Modena's tracts, were
pondering his teaching and waiting for the times to
ripen. But Mazzini's influence, even if the most
powerful, was not the only one. Traditions still lived
on, handed down from the Carbonaro revolutions;
the old belief in Charles Albert was flickering into
life again; the mild Catholic nationalism, that came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
from Manzoni and his school, flowed strong; and all
the time the daily witness of oppression and misrule
was there to preach against the Austrians and the
native tyrants. And though there were many currents
in the swelling crowd of nationalists, at two points all
moved together. Austria must go, and there must be
some guarantee for good government.</p>

<p>In spite of censors and police, the rising spirit
showed itself in literature. "The shade of Dante, the
poet of the regenerated nation, began to brood above
the speech and silence of the land." Students, in the
footsteps of Foscolo and Gabriel Rossetti, drew all the
reading world of Italy to the great national seer, who
more than five centuries before had pleaded for unity.
Dramatists and historians and novel-writers spoke of
the ancient glories of their country. Social reformers
came in to swell the liberal movement, founders of
schools and savings banks, agricultural pioneers,
builders of railways that would "stitch the boot."
Their interest in politics was a secondary one, and
such political sympathies as they had, were generally
with the Moderate politicians, just rising to a prominence,
which was soon to eclipse Mazzini's waning
light. Gioberti had already published his <i>Moral and
Civil Primacy of the Italians</i>, which, while it echoed
Mazzini's faith in Italy and Rome, banned democracy
and unity, preached federalism and half-hearted
liberalism, and looked for salvation to Charles Albert
and a reforming Pope. Cesare Balbo in Piedmont
was pleading for the same mild policy, without its
faith in the Papacy. Theirs was an easy creed
beside Mazzini's. They had little of his religious
faith, none of his passionate democracy, his demand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
for sacrifice and martyrdom. It was a creed for the
doubting and half-hearted, for the royalist and
Catholic, for the courtier and the rich man and the
priest; and also for the level-headed man of the
world, who turned from Mazzini's fancies and idealism,
who laughed at Italy's mission to humanity but
cherished a more modest hope for her own regeneration.
But at all events the teaching had two notes in
common with his own. It strove to lift the nation to
healthy ambition and strenuous effort; it cried as
earnestly as he did for the expulsion of the Austrian.
And so it made the complement of his work. Less
noble in its spirit, more halting in its patriotism and
uninspiring of great deeds, yet it marshalled for the
cause a host, that would never have swelled the thin
ranks of Young Italy. It supplied the common
movement with qualities that Mazzini conspicuously
lacked,&mdash;a political sense of the possible, and, among
its better exponents, a patience and tolerance, a
comprehensiveness that prejudged no class and
welcomed all, who, gladly or reluctantly, offered themselves
for the great task.</p>

<p>One of the sources of the Moderate movement was
the impatience at the little insurrections, that only led
to useless loss of life and an embittering of the
tyranny. One of its postulates laid down that there
should be no revolt against the better native princes,
and that the fight with Austria should be waged by
regular armies. But the traditions of revolt could not
die out at once, indeed were all the stronger for the
new spirit of hope that was abroad. All Central
Italy was alive with plots. Mazzini, though he was
coming partially to recognize the futility of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
petty risings, still had a standard of preparation
that was pitifully inadequate. He was elaborating
a scheme for a rising in the Papal States, to be
followed by movements in the North and South
and supported by the exiles. He was still persuaded
that a few small guerilla bands would draw the
people after them, that daring and a clear programme
were the only necessary conditions of victory. He
found few men and less money for his plot. Among
the handful, who put themselves at his disposal, were
two young Venetian nobles, Attilio and Emilio
Bandiera, officers in the Austrian navy, which was
chiefly manned by Italians and Dalmatians. They
were high-minded lads, and, one is bound to add,
sentimentalists and prigs, naively self-conscious and
immature; but with the supreme virtue that they
were ready to take their lives in their hands.
Mazzini wished to use them for his designs in
Central Italy; but there were police agents of the
governments around them, who had their ear and
sent them with a handful of followers, including a
man in the pay of the police, to help an imaginary
rising in Calabria. The English government, too,
had opened their correspondence with Mazzini, and
put the government at Naples on its guard. Thus
they went, as they foreboded, to their death. The
trap was ready for them; and when they landed
near Cosenza, they were captured easily and shot.</p>

<p>The ignoble action of the English government
brought Mazzini into English political life. He suspected
that his correspondence had been tampered
with in the post, and careful experiments proved to
him that his letters had been opened, sealed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
new wafers, and the postmark altered. He put the
matter into the hands of Thomas Duncombe, the
member for Finsbury; and the storm of indignation,
that followed Duncombe's disclosures in the House
of Commons, showed how angrily the better English
opinion felt it, that the government had violated
elementary ethics and "played the spy" in the
interests of continental tyranny. Shiel and Macaulay
denounced it in parliament. Carlyle wrote to the
<i>Times</i> that "it is a question vital to us that sealed
letters in an English post-office be, as we all fancied
they were, respected as things sacred; that opening
of men's letters, a practice near of kin to picking
men's pockets, and to other still viler and far fataler
forms of scoundrelism, be not resorted to except in
cases of very last extremity." The government tried
to ride out the storm with quibbles and constructive
falsehoods, which proved, as Mazzini said, that they
adopted different standards of honour for their public
and their private lives. Sir James Graham repeated
the stale charge that Mazzini had promoted assassination
in France, and honourably withdrew it, when he
knew the facts. But public feeling was too heated
to let the matter rest there; and secret Committees of
enquiry were appointed by both Houses. They reported
that letters had been constantly opened at the
Post-Office, at all events since 1806; that even letters
of members of parliament had been tampered with;
that in this case the government had issued a warrant
to open Mazzini's letters (his letters had in fact been
opened several months before the date of the warrant),
and had sent information extracted from them to "a
Foreign Power." It is true that this information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
seems to have been of a general character, but that
did not affect the ignominy of the whole business
or the fact that an English government had sent a
warning to the Bourbons, that helped them to entrap
the hapless patriots.</p>

<p>The incident gave Mazzini a welcome opportunity
to appeal more directly to English opinion on behalf
of Italy. He had a supreme contempt for English
foreign policy, which "opposes everything that introduces
a new fact in the European polity, and is the
first to recognize it when it shows its strength." It
was an unfair criticism, at least of Canning and
Palmerston, tied though the latter's hands were by
court and colleagues. England was still on the whole
the champion of the cause of men. But it was true
that the Foreign Office gave small attention to the
great nationalist movements that were maturing in
Europe. The wise policy for England, as he urged,
was to encourage these movements, and win the
gratitude of the rising nationalities, not necessarily
by armed intervention (he expressly disclaimed asking
for that), but by her moral backing. Perhaps
it was partly owing to the seeds he sowed at this
time, that Palmerston afterwards did for Italy so
much of what he asked for. We may regret that
he never gave a generous recognition to the great
Foreign Secretary's policy.</p>

<p>On individual Englishmen and Americans he knew
that he could count for practical sympathy. He
exploited well both the anti-Papal feeling in the
country and the old love of Italian liberty, which
had descended from the days of Byron and Hobhouse.
English and American travellers carried his secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
letters and literature into Italy. He had plans for
utilizing the Christian Alliance, an American society
for Protestant propagandism. A year or two later
he induced his English women-friends to organize an
Italian bazaar, which was held at Mrs Milner-Gibson's,
nominally for the expenses of his Italian school, but
with the secret intention of devoting any surplus from
the Italian contributions to a National Fund, which
he was trying to raise for political work. In the
same year, 1847, he founded a People's International
League to resume the interrupted work of Young
Europe, but mainly with the object of enlisting sympathy
for Italy. Stansfeld, the Ashursts, Peter Taylor,
W. Shaen, Thomas Cooper, Henry Vincent the
Chartist, W. J. Fox (the Unitarian orator, afterwards
M.P. for Oldham), served on the Committee. They
used to meet once a week at Mr W. J. Linton's house
in Hatton Garden, and Mazzini "with those wondrous
eyes of his lit up with a power that was almost
overwhelming," infected them with his own enthusiasm
and faith. Men among them, like Thomas Cooper
and Peter Taylor, who had denounced physical force
remedies in England, demurred at his gospel of
revolution. "You are right about your own country,"
he passionately answered. "You have had your grand
decisive struggle against tyrannous power. You need
no physical force. But what are my countrymen to
do, who are trodden down under the iron heel of a
foreign tyranny? They have no representation, they
have no charters, they have no written rights. They
must fight."</p>

<p>The business of the League brought one of the
very few occasions, on which, so far as is known,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
he expressed his views on Ireland. Some Repealers
complained to the League that it had omitted Ireland
in its report from the list of the nationalities of the
future; and Mazzini was asked to draft an answer to
them. His argument was addressed to Separatists,
but it would apply almost equally to Home Rulers;
it proves how radically he misunderstood the Irish
movement, and he seems to have felt himself on
unsafe ground. He regarded the Irish demand as
at bottom one for better government only; and he
had every sympathy with their "just consciousness
of human dignity, claiming its long violated rights,"
their "wish to have rulers, educators, not masters,"
their protests against "legislation grounded on distrust
and hostility." But he believed that the nationalist
movement was not likely to be permanent, and he refused
to see any elements of true nationality in it, on the
grounds that the Irish did not "plead for any distinct
principle of life or system of legislation, derived from
native peculiarities, and contrasting radically with
English wants and wishes," nor claimed for their
country any "high special function" to discharge in
the interests of humanity. On which it may be noted
that the first objection shows Mazzini's ill-acquaintance
with Irish life and feeling, and that the second involves
a condition, which, save in his own theories, has not
been asked of any nation.</p>

<p class="p2">In place of the enforced idleness of a few years
before, he was now only too busy. Political correspondence,
literary work, the school, the bazaar, visiting
and being visited crowded on his time. He hardly
left London, except for two visits to France and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
perhaps to Italy, and once for a pilgrimage to Newstead
Abbey and other places of Byronic memory. He
had left Chelsea, and moved first to Devonshire Street,
near the British Museum, and afterwards to Cropley
Street, near the New North Road. He was somewhat
happier and more hopeful. His active life left
little time for the old broodings. The Post-Office
scandal had brought him new friends, and the desolation
of his solitude had gone. He joined the Whittington
Club, largely for the sake of playing chess,
at which he was an adept and did not like being
beaten. He was much perturbed by a proposal to
allow no chess on Sundays, and jokingly threatens a
rider that smoking too shall be forbidden, except to
those who undertake to sit silent for an hour in
religious contemplation, and that, as further penance
for the members, one of them shall "read twelve
minutes every hour <i>alta voce e con declamazione</i> a
parliamentary speech from Mr Plumpton or Sir Robert
Inglis or a chapter from the second volume of Tancred
by D'Israeli." But when back in his lodgings, he was
often depressed and miserable again. He was "giddy"
with writing, worn down with work and want of proper
food and clothes; and for the first time he writes in
bad spirits about his physical condition. The burden
of poverty and debt still "dominated his life." He
was now in receipt of a small allowance from his
mother, to find which she stinted herself of every
luxury and more. But he was generous as ever, and
probably as bad a housekeeper; and he found himself
powerless to reduce the mountain of debt. His literary
earnings were again very small. The life of Foscolo was
still waiting to be begun, for he thought it better now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
"to supply new materials for Italian history than make
an inventory of the old." The better-paying reviews
no longer took his articles, and he was "writing on
Switzerland and heaven knows what for a petty Edinburgh
magazine." He fretted because the need of
hack-work and his multifarious occupations left little
time for writings that would help the cause, as they
had helped it fifteen years ago. "For the wretched
sum of some 8000 francs," he writes, "I am a slave;
I am growing old in body, in soul, in power, and I am
not allowed to help my country and fulfil my mission."
And from causes that we can only guess at,&mdash;perhaps
the worry and publicity, perhaps the partial lifting of
his unhappiness, perhaps the loss of physical health,&mdash;there
is a perceptible, though slight decline from the
moral height of a few years before. He is less the
apostle, more the politician, too fond of coming forward
as the practical man&mdash;a part that ill became
him,&mdash;not always straightforward in his utterances and
methods, more reasonable, it is true, and tolerant, but
at the same time sliding into occasional reticences and
equivocation.</p>

<p>The result of the Bandiera episode was to leave
Young Italy yet more friendless than before. Its
miserable mismanagement was set down to Mazzini,
unfairly on the whole; and cruel slanders charged
him with egging others to a desperate task, while he
stayed safe behind. In reality, he was more impatient
than ever to lead a fight in Italy "before he grew
quite old." But he seems again to have recognized
that any fruitful action was impossible. All his efforts
for the National Fund brought in a poor £100. And
he knew that he was losing his hold on the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
classes, and must wait till he had formed a party
among the working men of the towns. The Rimini
revolt of 1845, its poor programme of local
reform and silence on the bigger issues, proved what
influence the Moderate movement in its worst and
weakest form had even in those parts of Italy, from
which he had hoped most. A year later the Moderates
leaped into overwhelming prominence with the accession
of Pio Nono to the Papacy. Here was a Pope,
the Italians fondly thought, eager to bless Liberals
and Nationalists, while Charles Albert in the North
was threatening to bare his sword for war. The mass
of Italian Liberalism caught at their protection, and
was ready to pay the price. Some no doubt hoped
to push on the King, till he was "moral," if not actual
"lord of Italy"; others dreamed that circumstances
might make Pius president of an Italian Republic.
But the majority willingly accepted the limitations of
the policy, were ready to safeguard the Temporal
Power, to make Italian union no better than a loose
federation, to stop short at administrative reform or at
the most at middle-class constitutions.</p>

<p>Mazzini was very suspicious of the new development;
jealous that the nationalist movement had passed into
other hands, that the credit of it went to men like
Gioberti, who had halted in their faith, while he alone
had held the banner high; sceptical of Charles Albert's
and the Pope's intentions; angry at the tentative,
compromising ambitions of the Moderates, at their
repudiation of democracy, their trust in diplomacy
and its pretences and deceptions. He knew Charles
Albert's "rabbit-nature"; he judged Pio Nono much
at his own estimate. "They want," said the Pope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
"to make a Napoleon of me, who am only a poor
country parson." "An honest parson but a bad
prince," was Mazzini's verdict. The triumph of the
Moderates meant that Unity would be put indefinitely
back, and federalism inflict "perpetual impotence" on
Italy. But he saw the impossibility of standing out
against the new spirit. And he was prepared, as he
had been in 1833 and again in 1844, to waive his
republican agitation, if the Moderates for their part
would abandon federalism and declare for unity. "If
I thought," he said, "that Charles Albert would rise
to rare ambition and unite Italy for his own behoof, I
would say Amen." "Let the Moderates," he wrote,
"give us, if they like, a Pope, a single king, a
dictator; we can compromise on everything but
federalism." And on these lines he was working
through 1847 to bring the exiles at Paris together
on a common programme of Unity, to which both
monarchists and republicans could rally.</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that in September of the same
year he wrote his famous letter to the Pope. As
with the parallel letter to Charles Albert, he was
anxious afterwards to explain away in part its implied
belief in the Pope's patriotism and its anxiety to see
him leader of the Italian movement. But his private
letters of the time would seem to show that this was
an afterthought, and that he was sincerer than he gave
himself credit for. In one of them, written apparently
just before the letter to Pius, he says in somewhat
Carlylean style, "I consider this as the last agony
of popedom authority. And in my own way of
feeling I would not be sorry to see a great institution
dying, for once, in a noble manner; transmitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the watchword of the future before vanishing, rather
than sinking into the Crockford or Tuileries mud of
the English aristocracy and French monarchy. A
moral power, like a great man, ought always to die
so; uttering the words of dying Goethe, 'let more light
in.'" In another letter, written in the same month,
he says that he wrote to the Pope "in a moment of
expansiveness and juvenile illusion," as he would
have written to his friend himself. He was excited
and sanguine at the great European drama, that was
developing so fast. He still probably had moments,
when the old faith in men broke through his later
suspicion and exclusiveness. He was ever looking
for a new religion to issue forth from Rome,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and for the
moment dreamed that a nationalist Pope might be its
herald. His appeal, however, was ludicrous in its miscalculation
of the facts. "Be a believer," he said to
Pius, "and unite Italy." He told him that he, the
foremost man of the moment in Europe, had duties of
corresponding magnitude. He could guide Italy to
her appointed future, make of her one great state,
based on the people and justice and religion, with "a
government unique in Europe, which would end the
absurd divorce between the spiritual and temporal
powers." If Catholicism were capable of revival, he
under God might be the instrument; if it were
destined to give place to a new creed, based on the
same Christian principles, he could be the leader, who
would guide the Church securely through its passage.
One can imagine the horror with which Pius read the
part so tactlessly suggested to him; and we know that
the only result of the letter was to thoroughly alarm him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>In fact Mazzini's fits of belief in Pope or King
were very transitory. Only five months before he
had written in an open letter, that he "did not
believe that from prince or king or pope Italy would
now or ever find salvation." His mind was in a state
of flux, wavering between his old simple, but for the
time impracticable, creed and some compromise with
the new order. It would read him wrongly, if we
charged him with downright insincerity; but his
whole conduct through this period is a disingenuous
one, too subordinate to unavowed intentions, too
much akin to that "substitution of Macchiavelli for
Dante," which he condemned so unsparingly in the
Moderates. While professedly ready to work with
the monarchical nationalists, while abstaining from
any active republican agitation, he was encouraging
republican beliefs, anxious even to keep something
together of a republican organization, that when
"the Moderate farce was hissed off the stage," the
republicans would be again in a position to captain
the nationalist cause and lead it to their own goal.
He wants to spread the literature of Young Italy
broadcast. He urges that his followers, while
nominally joining the Moderate ranks and "shouting
for Pio Nono louder than the rest," should quietly
prepare to seize the movement for themselves. At
the same time, outside Italy they were to depreciate
the Pope with equal vehemency, that when the
inevitable disillusioning in Pius came, they could put
in a claim to foresight. Apart from this underhand
diplomacy, his hesitation was largely justified. He
had no security that the Moderates would accept the
offered compromise or declare for Unity. And he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
feared that the enthusiasm of the masses might
evaporate in noisy demonstrations, that reform would
prove an opiate to lull the nationalist impulses to
sleep again. Towards the end of 1847 his chief
anxiety, as Cavour's was for different reasons twelve
years later, was to irritate Austria into taking the
offensive, and force the Italians to fight for independence.
He was confident that she would intervene.
Sometimes he hoped that the popular pressure behind
would force Charles Albert to head the national
defence; at other moments he welcomed the thought
that the native governments would decline the
challenge, and Young Italy be left alone to lead
the war.</p>

<p>For once he underrated the strength of the
nationalist feeling. The new year opened with
revolutions in dramatic sequence. Its first day saw
the Tobacco Riots at Milan,&mdash;the overture to the
maturing Lombard rising. Two days later the social
revolution mildly reared its head at Leghorn, and
Mazzini's old collaborator, Guerrazzi, was master for
a few days of the insurgent city. In another fortnight
Sicily, with one great effort, threw off the Bourbon
yoke; and before the month was out, the Neapolitans
had forced a constitution on King Ferdinand. In
the first half of February Tuscany and Piedmont had
their constitutions too; in a few days more the
Second Republic was proclaimed in France, and the
face of European politics was changed. Pio Nono,
ever more fearful of liberalism, but carried helplessly
along, gave the Romans a constitution; and, save in
the Austrian provinces and dependant Duchies, all
Italy had won its liberties. War with Austria was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
now only a question of weeks, and the nation waited
breathlessly till the signal came from Milan or Turin.
Charles Albert was still the "Wobbling King," drifting
towards war, thirsting for national applause and
revenge on Austria, but timorous of the democratic
forces that pushed on behind, dreading republican
France as much as the real enemy across the
Ticino.</p>

<p>While he paused, the great uprising came. The
news of revolution at Vienna passed the signal
through the North. The heroic Milanese after five
days of memorable struggle drove the great garrison
out in flight. Venice, Bergamo, Brescia, Como, well-nigh
every city in the Lombard and Venetian lands,
fought for and won their liberty. The Austrian
power crumbled in a week, and save at Ferrara and
the fortresses of the Quadrilateral,&mdash;themselves too
all but lost,&mdash;no foot of Italian ground remained to
Austria. From all Italy the forces of the nation
were hurrying to complete the work. Piedmont and
Tuscany declared war. The Pope and King of Naples
let perforce their troops march to the front. From
town and village, from plain and mountain valley the
volunteers poured up. Princes and statesmen, clergy
and nobles, students and artisans,&mdash;all were swept
along by the great flood of patriotism, some lightly
or with purpose to betray, but the mass with the
enthusiasm of crusaders, glad, for the day at all events,
to give up comfort and home and life. It seemed
as if Mazzini's vision were fulfilled, and Italy, transfigured
by a holy call, had risen in unconquerable
might.</p>

<p>Mazzini hurried to Italy at the glad tidings. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
was already in Paris, where he had gone again directly
after the Revolution, and had just founded a National
Association to carry out his policy of bringing royalist
and republican exiles together in the cause of independence
and unity. He crossed the St Gotthard
with some danger. "The scene," he wrote back to
England, "was sublime, Godlike. No one knows
what poetry is, who has not found himself there, at
the highest point of the route, on the plateau, surrounded
by the peaks of the Alps in the everlasting
silence that speaks of God. There is no atheism
possible on the Alps." He stopped to pick the first
pansy he saw, when he left the snows, to send it to
an English friend. He reached Milan on April 7.
He could not go to Piedmont or Genoa, for the
sentence of 1833 still hung over him, and, besides,
Milan was the centre of everything at the moment.
But the scene of the Five Days did not bring the
sense of exultation he had expected. "As for Italy,"
he writes, "I have grown old, and seem only too
much to bear the chains of exile with me." But he
"cried like a child" with enthusiasm, when he saw
two thousand Italians, who had deserted from an
Austrian regiment, march through the shouting crowd;
and the reception he found must soon have cheered
him. The very customs-officers on the frontier had
known him from his portraits, and repeated his phrases
to him. A procession met him at the gates of Milan,
and took him in triumph to his hotel. His position
was in fact a very strong one. He stood before his
countrymen as the prophet once cast out and stoned,
who had preached in the wilderness, what was now a
commonplace on every tongue. His beliefs of yesterday&mdash;utopias
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to other men&mdash;were potent facts to-day.
Italy was free or nearly so. Throughout the land
democracy seemed on the eve of triumph. Even the
republicans and unitarians had shown an unexpected
strength. And he, who through long years had
preached and suffered, while others fell away or
doubted, had the grateful homage of his countrymen.
At this time, probably, his word was law at
Milan.</p>

<p>It remained to be seen if he had the talent for
actual political life, whether he could put away
accumulated prejudices, see clear to the supreme and
indispensable end, and waive all secondary things for
that. His professed position was a sound one.
While the war lasted, so he laid down, there must&mdash;apart
from the postulate of Unity&mdash;be a truce to
party struggles. Monarchy or republic must await
the decision of the liberated and united nation;
and meanwhile the whole strength of the country
must be given to the war. His earlier actions
were true to this programme. He supported the
Provisional Government, and discouraged the extremer
republicans. Probably, as he hinted later, he
was half inclined at first to believe that Charles
Albert was the fittest instrument for the deliverance
of Italy. And though he soon abandoned
any hope in the King, he repeated to the end that,
while the war lasted, there should be no republican
agitation.</p>

<p>So far as the war itself was concerned, he did his
best in the one way open to him, the encouragement
of the volunteers. He exaggerated their military
value, just as he had always exaggerated the possibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of guerilla fighting in Italy. But his advice
that every available man should be thrown on the
enemy's communications in Venetia was better
strategy and patriotism than the poor jealousies, that
made the regular army and the politicians depreciate
the volunteers from fear lest their influence should be
cast for a republic. In a fight, where the Italians had
no single commander of genius, the Moderates had
the folly to reject the services of men, like Garibaldi
and Fanti, who twelve years later were the first
generals in Italy. But, sincerely as Mazzini tried to
help the war, he was not equally loyal to his professions
of political neutrality. His refusal to let
unity remain an open question deprived them at once
of any seriousness. Even his ostensible attitude
towards the monarchy was no doubt in part a matter
more of necessity than principle. He seems to have
gone to Milan undecided what exact policy to adopt;
and as soon as he arrived there, he wrote that he was
occupied in organizing the republicans, and that,
should Charles Albert fail to gain a speedy and
brilliant victory, he had hopes of success for them.
But he soon realized that a republican agitation meant,
if not civil war, at all events a fierce dissension in the
face of the enemy, a dissension on no point of vital
principle or honour,&mdash;which would have shamed its
author. And, though the republicans were strong at
Milan, they were perhaps a minority even there, and
in the rest of Lombardy a handful, while Piedmont
and its army stood solid in their loyalty to the King.
And so, whether from choice or from necessity, he
stood in the letter by his promise to abstain from
republican agitation. But the policy of neutrality sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
uneasily on him, and he soon broke from the spirit of
his undertaking by loud professions of republican faith
and suggestions quite inconsistent with the silence he
was pledged to.</p>

<p>To some extent the policy of the Provisional
Government excused his change of attitude. At the
beginning of the war everybody had accepted the
position, that there should be a truce to politics
till the fighting was over. But as the war dragged
on, the position became a hardly possible one. The
government of Lombardy was hopelessly incapable,
and everybody wished to see it superseded. The
conservatives both at Milan and Turin feared to
leave an opening for a possible Lombard republic
after the war. Many of the democrats wished for
annexation as a step to Unity. The agitation for
"fusion" with Piedmont grew so strong, that the
government, not unwillingly, capitulated, and ordered
a plebiscite to be taken on the question whether
fusion should take place at once. When the voting
came, there was no doubt abundance of intimidation
by the fusionists; but the overwhelming majority
that declared for them proved that the desire for a
North Italian Kingdom was predominant in the politics
of the moment.</p>

<p>Almost irresistible as the forces were that made
for fusion, Mazzini was strictly accurate in branding
it as a breach of faith. The fusionists had tried
to win him over. The King had sent a message,
that, if he would use his influence with the republicans
in favour of fusion, he should have an
interview with himself, and exercise as much influence
as he wished in drafting the constitution on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
democratic lines.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The offer was a generous and
patriotic one, but Mazzini consented only on condition
that the King would publicly declare for Unity,
and sign a bombastic promise to be "the priest-king
of the new age." Naturally no answer came to this,
and Mazzini broke into polemics, that the bad faith
of the other side did something to excuse, but which
were none the less opposed to the spirit of his
pledge. Italy, he said, would never be united, till
the flag of the republic flew at Rome. He pleaded
that France should adopt a frankly "republican and
revolutionary" diplomacy. Royalty was "a hereditary
lie," and the republic the only government which
would put the best citizens in power. Now and
again he shot stinging phrases at his opponents,
that only added to the bitterness of faction; for, as
often, even when Mazzini tried to be tolerant, his
pen ran away with him. He attacked the Turin
nobles, forgetting that they and their sons were at
the war, giving their lives for the cause he loved.
No doubt he had provocation, and the baser Moderates
were even more intolerant, but none the less he was
playing a hurtful and ungenerous part.</p>

<p>He made, in fact, a grave blunder in staying at
Milan. His presence there did little to help the
war; it was, whether he wished it or not, a standing
encouragement to the factiousness, that was not a
little responsible for the ill-fortune of the army. His
place was at Rome. At bottom the Italians were
defeated through the feebleness of Charles Albert's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
generalship and policy and the defection of the Pope
and King of Naples. Mazzini could do nothing to
make a capable commander of the King; but he
might have influenced his policy. Charles Albert,
timid and conventional as he was, had had his hand
forced already and was prepared to have it forced
again, as his son's was a few years later. Mazzini
judged the King accurately and not unkindly; but
his attitude towards him was lacking in all tact.
Bad-tempered attacks on the monarchy, melodramatic
appeals for a "priest-king," suggestions that the united
nation would proclaim the republic from the Capitol,
could only alarm. But had the popular pressure been
sufficient and well-directed, Charles Albert would, half
fearfully but half gladly, have felt his way to the
crown of Italy. He had a deep belief in nationality;
he dearly loved popular applause. Romagna
was only waiting for his signal to come over to
him. Piedmontese agents were at work in Tuscany,
and it is hard to believe that he had not approved
their mission. He hesitated long before he declined
for his son the crown that Sicily laid at his feet.
Had Mazzini gone to Rome, he would have given a
great impulse to the radicals and unitarians there. It
would almost certainly have decided the Romagnuols;
it would not impossibly have created such a force of
opinion in all Central Italy, as would have overborne
the autonomist parties and the King's own hesitations,
and put all the Papal States and Tuscany under his
suzerainty. Nay more, though the counter-revolution
had triumphed at Naples, the nationalist elements
were strong throughout the South; and had Mazzini
organized them from Rome, and Garibaldi marched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
South in the name of Unity and Charles Albert, the
work of 1860 might have been done twelve years
earlier. Even had the bigger consummation failed,
Mazzini could have forced the Pope to choose between
a nationalist policy and deposition from his temporal
throne; he would have thrown all the energies of the
Roman government into the war, and given Charles
Albert another ten or twenty thousand men, enough
to shift the scales of victory.</p>

</p>

<p>Had he done this, he might have averted the
catastrophe, which quenched the nation's hopes in
swift disaster. In one pitched fight after another the
Italians had won. But courage could not repair bad
generalship and growing inferiority of numbers, and
Mazzini foretold disaster only too accurately. At
the end of July the collapse came, and the army,
still fighting doggedly, but starved and outman&oelig;uvred,
retreated on Milan. For some weeks past Mazzini
had urged that a small committee of defence should
be appointed; and when disaster threatened, he was
allowed to nominate his men. He chose Fanti and
two others, who did their best in the short time to
organize the defence of the city. The Milanese rose
again to something of the spirit of the Five Days;
but it was too late to turn the tide of victory. The
army made a gallant fight outside the city walls, but
were driven back within the gates. The unhappy
king would fain have fought on still, but he knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
there was no hope of victory, and after long hesitation
he surrendered the city. The people, maddened
by the desertion, attacked the palace where he lodged,
and it was with difficulty that his life was saved.
Sullenly he and his army withdrew, followed by
thousands of the citizens, intolerant of Austrian
rule.</p>

<p>Mazzini left Milan, as soon as the army arrived,
shouldering a rifle that Mrs Ashurst had given him
when he left England. He had persuaded himself
that a popular rising might have saved the city,
but that the army could not. He started to join
Garibaldi, who was in command of the volunteers at
Bergamo, and met a detachment of them at Monza.
Their flag had "God and the People" for its legend,
and the volunteers chose Mazzini to carry it. Garibaldi's
small force of three thousand men made a difficult
retreat, in terrible weather and ever harassed by the
Austrian cavalry. Mazzini, frail and exhausted, won
their admiration by his endurance and intrepidity.
He was happy doubtless to have a simple task,
which only asked for physical courage, after the
tangled politics of the last four months.</p>

<p>The volunteers disbanded when they had passed
the frontier, for the national cause seemed desperate.
The army had retreated into Piedmont, and the King
had signed an armistice. The Roman and Tuscan
forces hardly existed; Naples was at the mercy of
King Ferdinand. The Austrians had triumphed
swiftly and conclusively. They dared not indeed
cross the Ticino for fear of French intervention, they
were not strong enough as yet to advance into Central
Italy, and Venice defied them in her lagunes; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Lombardy and the Venetian mainland seemed lost
past hope. Mazzini refused to own defeat. But
he based his hopes more on partisan illusions than
on cool possibilities. The royal war had ended; the
people's war would begin. The Italians, betrayed
by their princes, would rise in their own strength,
and crush the Austrians by force of numbers and
enthusiasm. He was working feverishly at Lugano
to create a national organization to this end, and
prepare for a popular rising in Lombardy. Again
he wavered whether or not to raise the republican
flag. Providence, he thought, had by the recent
disasters pointed the Italians to a republic. But,
at all events after the fiasco of a mad rising near
Como, he recognized the hopelessness of an unsupported
insurrection in the Austrian provinces.
He saw, as cooler heads saw all along, that the
Piedmontese army was indispensable; and, while
urging the Romans to declare for a republic there,
he was willing to postpone the political question
elsewhere, and work with any, who would relegate it
to the decision of a Constituent Assembly after the
war and throw their strength into a new fight. He
recognized at last that his own best field was in
Central Italy. Various motives drew him there.
He could use his influence at Florence and Rome
to push on the military preparations; he could perhaps
secure a union of the two states, which would be
a step towards unity; he might, if circumstances
favoured, help to plant the republican flag. Both
in Tuscany and at Rome democracy was triumphant.
The Pope had fled to Ferdinand's fortress at Gaeta,
and the Romans, finding every overture for compromise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
rejected, and left without a stable government,
were heading irresistibly for a republic. At Florence
the Grand Duke was at the mercy of the democrats,
with no alternative before him but flight or unconditional
surrender. Mazzini left Lugano, and sailing
from Marseilles, arrived at Leghorn on February 8,
just when the news had come that the Grand Duke
had fled from Florence. He used his influence to
prevent any attack on the ducalists and dissuade the
Livornese from secession. A week later he was at
Florence. Here he saw Giuditta Sidoli, at whose house
he met Gino Capponi, and paid a visit to Giusti. But
he had little time for the society of friends. Guerrazzi
was now virtually dictator of Tuscany. More practical
in small things than Mazzini, but with none of his
inspiring confidence or simple loyalty to an idea, he
was trying to steer a middle course and keep clear
of a republic. He and Mazzini had hot words, and
Mazzini, backed by a great republican meeting by
Orcagna's Loggia, forced him to a nominal and insincere
acceptance of its programme. After fruitless
efforts to promote union with the Roman states, and
make the slow Tuscans prepare for war, Mazzini left
for Rome.</p>

<p>Ever since the Pope's flight in November, he had
been appealing to his friends there to agitate for a
republic. The road, he urged, was plain. The
Pope had virtually abdicated, and, without a blow,
the republic was in their grasp,&mdash;a republic, which
might grow into a republican Italy. "You have,"
he wrote, "in your hands the destinies of Italy,
and the destinies of Italy are the destinies of the
world." It was one of the master-ideas of his life,
cherished through years of meditation from the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
days of Young Italy. The thought was a fantastic
one; a student's conceit, fed on his early classical
studies, on his later readings in medieval history,
above all on Dante's faith in Rome, the destined
seat of Empire; a strange historical survival, born
of what Cesare Balbo called "the importunate memory
of Rome's past greatness," which translated into
modern terms the theories of the Holy Roman
Empire. Many an Italian in those days shared that
faith,&mdash;a faith that fed their inextinguishable resolve
that Rome should be the capital of Italy. Mazzini
and Gioberti went beyond, and looked to Rome for
some new word of truth for all humanity. But
while Gioberti's destined instrument was a reformed
Papacy, Mazzini watched for a Pope-less, republican,
Italian Rome to bring the dawn of that "religious
transformation," Christian in spirit and in origin
but with another dogma, which would again unite
mankind in a living, universal faith. Indefinite as
his conception was, the thought of an all-embracing
unity, the "word of universal brotherhood"&mdash;the
necessary mark of any great religion&mdash;runs through it
all. As Imperial Rome had united Europe by force
of arms and majesty of law, as Papal Rome had
united it by thought and spiritual authority, so
"Rome of the People" would unite it once again
in some new gospel of social duty and progress,
would harmonize the temporal and the spiritual, the
Roman law of justice and the Christian law of sacrifice.
When nationality had remodelled Europe, then would
eternal Rome, destined alone of cities to rise more
mighty from each fall, be hailed its moral centre,
seat of a diet of the nations, to teach to them their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
common duties to humanity.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Who will say that this
last more modest vision may not some day and in
some sense be fulfilled?</p>

<p>Partly in consequence of Mazzini's incentives, more
from force of circumstances, the republic was proclaimed
at Rome on the day after he landed at
Leghorn. The Assembly, a fairly level-headed body,
elected on manhood suffrage and drawing its members
from the larger landed proprietors and upper middle
classes, had voted for it by a great majority; and
the republican Triumvirs had discoursed in true
Mazzinian phrases, and headed their acts with the
rubric "God and the People." On the fourth day
of the republic the Assembly unanimously made
Mazzini citizen of Rome, and invited him to come.
He started as soon as he could leave Tuscany, and
arrived on the evening of March 5, slipping into the
city unobserved, "awed and like a worshipper," feeling,
as he passed under the Porta del Popolo, "a spurt
of new life," that for the moment swept away
doubtings and disappointments. His first thought
was to organize for the impending war. Piedmont,
unreconciled to defeat and stung by Austrian brutalities
in Lombardy, was about to denounce the armistice;
there were formidable preparations for insurrection
in the Lombard cities; Venice was undaunted and
threatening from her lagunes. Republican Rome must
not be behindhand. Mazzini made her anticipate the
belated appeal from Piedmont by offering ten thousand
men, and they had started for the North when the
news of Novara came.</p>

<p>Piedmont lay crushed by one staggering blow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and the hope of freeing Lombardy had gone. The
moment's task was to save Central Italy, and in
the imminent danger the Romans turned to the man
who had won their reverence and lifted them to
something of his own moral greatness. Mazzini was
made a Triumvir, and henceforth became little less
than dictator. He had probably at heart small hope
of saving the Republic, and to foreigners like Clough
and Margaret Fuller did not conceal his fears. But
the cause was not yet desperate. He knew he could
contemptuously disregard the Neapolitans, who were
hovering on the Southern frontier; and at this time
he could not foresee how base a part France was
soon to play. The Austrians were the only serious
enemy in sight; and with Hungary still untamed,
with the chance that Piedmont might brace itself to
a third effort, a desperate defence might yet keep
them at bay. He intended to treble the Roman
forces, and concentrating them at Terni, swoop down
on the long line of Austrian communications, as they
advanced along the Eastern coast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, among the cares of war, he began to
build a government that should be worthy of his
ideal. "Here in Rome," he told the bickering
politicians in the Assembly, "we may not be moral
mediocrities." He hoped to inspire government and
people with one great purpose, that would leave no
place for party-spirit or suspicion. He would have
no exclusiveness, no intolerance, no war of classes or
attacks on property or person. "Stiffness in principles,
tolerance to individuals" was the motto of his rule, and
to this, through all the troubled times that followed,
he was nobly true. At a time when national danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
might have excused severe precautions, the press
was hardly interfered with; there were few arrests,
fewer penalties, for political offences; conspirators,
with barely an exception, were left in contemptuous
tolerance, or merely warned not to let the people
know of their intrigues. It was this very leniency
to the men who were plotting the Republic's downfall,
that led to the few outrages that stained its
name. The civil service and police, left full of
enemies and lukewarm friends, lacked vigour to repress
the disorderly elements; and here and there
a fanatic or criminal took advantage of the murmurings
at Mazzini's tolerance to assassinate a Papalist.
But save in a few provincial towns, where political
murder was endemic, and for a few isolated outrages
at Rome, there was absolute security alike for friend
and foe. Mazzini's mild authority stands out in
luminous contrast with the Papal terrorism, that
scourged the unhappy land before and after.</p>

<p>The Triumvir's attitude to the Catholic Church is a
strange commentary on the myth, that writes him
down an anti-clerical fanatic. The man, who believed
Catholicism a spent force, whose whole soul yearned
for a new religion to issue forth from Rome, was yet
superlatively careful not to shake the people's one
religious creed. It would have been easy to do otherwise.
There was fierce exasperation at the Pope's
obduracy, at the ferocious fanaticism of men, who
would see Rome bombarded rather than yield one
tittle of their temporal power. Churches were half
empty, and, but for the government's precautions,
many another priest would have died the victim of the
people's anger. But Mazzini made it one of his first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
cares to protect the clergy in their spiritual work. His
deep religious instinct, old memories and friendships, his
respect for men who in their way were witnesses to the
spiritual, made him always tolerant towards them. "In
Italy," he once said, "the priest is powerless for harm but
powerful to do good"; and before this time and after he
made impassioned appeals to them to take their part in
the national work. He tried to win them now. It was
from no ill-will towards the Church that he did something
to repair the ecclesiastical misrule. Such reforms as he
effected were bound to go to the strengthening of a
church, made hateful by clerical domination; and many
were the priests and monks who defied the threatening
cardinals at Gaeta, and gladly rallied to the republic.
The nationalization of church lands, which Mazzini took
over from his predecessors, aimed at improving the
stipends of the poorer clergy. Religious services and processions
went on uninterrupted, and his one act of severity
towards the priests was to fine the canons of St Peter's for
refusing to celebrate the usual Easter services. "It is the
duty of the government," the Triumvirs said, "to preserve
religion uncontaminated." "Do not be afraid," he wrote
to a nun, who feared the suppression of her convent;
"pray God for our country and for men of good intentions."
Once in the fear of imminent attack upon the
city, the crowd fetched a few confessional boxes from the
churches to make barricades. Mazzini reminded them
that from those confessionals had come at all events
words of comfort to their mothers. It is perhaps the
most convincing proof of his grip on the people's hearts,
that the confessionals were taken back. With the Pope
himself he was ever ready to compromise. True, he
had postulated his expulsion and the downfall of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
authority as the condition of the new faith, for which
he yearned. But whether it was that the statesman
saw that the idealist must wait, or from his deep
respect for the institution round which hung so much
of Christian history, or that he wished to remove the
last pretext for the intervention of foreign Catholics,
his attitude went to the extreme of conciliatoriness.
At its first outset the Republic, while decreeing the
fall of the Temporal Power, had promised all necessary
guarantees for the Pope's spiritual authority; and
Mazzini, anticipating Cavour, tried to persuade the
Assembly to define the guarantees, and offer to consider
any suggestions for them that the Catholic
Powers chose to make. We must distinguish, he said,
the Pope from the Prince, and claim our rights
without doing violence to religious faith.</p>

<p>Thus noble and thus gentle was the Triumvir's rule,
and finely the people responded to it. At first there
had been small enthusiasm for the Republic. The
Romans had accepted it calmly, as the one alternative
to the intolerable rule of priests. But Mazzini touched
them with his own great faith. He appealed to no
selfish interests. He promised social legislation, but
it went into the background behind the national question;
and except for a land scheme to create a peasant
proprietary on the church lands, there was no time to
project much for their material well-being. His was
a pure spiritual ascendancy, that made a populace,
demoralized by bad government and charity, rise to
something of his own moral height and dare to bear
and die. There were some at all events, to whom
Rome, hallowed by a great ideal and noble rule, had
become as the city of God. Greatly their leader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
merited their love. The equivocations of the past
few months had gone, and in a clear position of
command, untrammelled by the need to compromise
with alien forces, he stood in all the majesty of his
translucent soul. It shone in his face; worn and
emaciated, he seemed to Margaret Fuller "more divine
than ever." His personal life, of which we have
grievously few records, was one of democratic simplicity.
Lodged in the Quirinal, he hunted for a room "small
enough to feel at home in." Here he sat unguarded
and serene, "sadly <span class="greek" title="adoryphoros">ἀδορύφορος</span> for a <span class="greek" title="tyrannos">τύραννος</span>," wrote
Clough (for it was a country where political assassination
was a tradition on both sides), as accessible to
working men and women as to his own officials, with
the same smile and warm hand-shake for all; dining for
two francs at a cheap restaurant, afterwards, during the
siege, living on bread and raisins, his only luxury the
flowers that an unknown hand sent every day, his one
relaxation to sing to his guitar when left alone at
night. The Triumvir's slender stipend of £32 a month
he spent entirely on others. As an administrator, he
was too gentle to be sufficiently prompt and stern.
He even refused to sign the death-warrant of a soldier
condemned by court-martial. But he made amends
by his unbending energy and the quick and fertile
intellect, that helped in every military detail of the
defence and made his diplomatic notes, so Palmerston
is said to have called them, "models of reasoning and
argument." Through all the tangled cares of government
he kept his calmness and serenity, the statesman's
right to lift his people to new visions and new powers.</p>

<p>His hope was to leave a great republican example.
Probably he dared expect no more. Sanguine no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
doubt he was, but in his cooler moments he seems
to have realized from the first that the powers of
evil were too strong for the noble little republic.
The blow came from an unexpected quarter. This
is not the place to dissect the causes, that led France
to the meanest of modern political crimes, that impelled
a state, pledged by its own constitution "never
to employ its forces against the liberties of another
people," to destroy an unoffending sister-republic.
France paid at Sedan for the carelessness of honour,
that allowed the Catholics and Louis Napoleon to
do a great crime in her name. When Oudinot's
expedition started, and, in spite of falsity on falsity,
it was plain that the French government intended
to crush the Romans, Mazzini's policy was clear.
He would not yield to brute, unrighteous force;
Rome, he told the Assembly, must "do its duty
and give a high example to every people and every
part of Italy." But to him the enemy was not
France but the French government. The true republicans
at Paris were striving courageously to save
the Romans and their own national honour; and on
their efforts depended the one hope of safety. He
would do nothing that would weaken their hands
or unnecessarily hurt French pride. When the
Assembly resolved without a dissentient voice to
resist at all cost, and Oudinot's troops were ingloriously
driven back, defeated by the raw Italian
levies, he refused to let Garibaldi make the rout
complete. The French prisoners were released after
generous and diplomatic hospitality. A monster gift
of cigars was sent to the enemy's quarters, wrapped
in handbills that appealed to republican fraternity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Perhaps someone remembered that eighty years before
the American Congress had sent the same ingenuous
present to the Hessian mercenaries.</p>

<p>Fraud and force alike had failed to open the gates
of Rome, and the long chapter of deceit went on,&mdash;deceit
hard to parallel even in the diplomacy of
great nations. Ferdinand de Lesseps, then a budding
attaché, was sent to parley with the Romans,
till Oudinot's reinforcements arrived, and the new
elections in France gave a Catholic majority in the
Chamber. It was a mere ruse, but de Lesseps was
Napoleon's dupe and negotiated in all good faith,
giving ample credit to Mazzini's "moderation and
loyalty and courage." Had they been left alone,
they would have concluded peace on terms honourable
to both sides, and Mazzini seems to have hoped
that the danger from France was passing. Garibaldi
was sent to meet the Neapolitans, who had advanced
as far as Albano, and drove them back in rout across
the frontier. King Ferdinand brevetted Ignatius
Loyola field-marshal of his army, but the very
posthumous honour could not exorcise the superstitious
terror, with which the great guerilla-chieftain's
name inspired his men. Had the Triumvirs been
free to let Garibaldi advance, the Bourbon power
would perhaps have crumbled, as it crumbled eleven
years later.</p>

<p>But at the moment when Mazzini and de Lesseps
had agreed on terms, the French government threw
off the mask, and Oudinot made a treacherous attack.
Then came the memorable siege, when for nearly a
month the badly-armed and badly-generalled Romans
kept at bay an army twice their number and a powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
siege artillery. Heroically they struggled on against
the overwhelming odds. The great majority of the
soldiers were natives of the state; but some had
gathered from all Italy, drawn by the spell of Rome
to fight once more for country. It was a band of
heroes, such as never came again together in the
Italian struggle; generals of the future like Medici
and Bixio; Manara, the Lombard leader in the
Five Days; Mameli, the war-poet of Italy, son of
the woman who had been Mazzini's boyish love;
Ugo Bassi, the priest-patriot, greatest Italian preacher
of his day, nearest of spiritual kin to Mazzini's self;
Bertani, the future organizer of the Sicilian Thousand
and Pisacane their precursor; and the great protagonists
themselves, Mazzini and Garibaldi;&mdash;a diverse
band, patricians and plebeians, saints and sinners,
royalists and republicans, all moved by one supreme
redeeming love of Italy and Rome. Within, the city
showed a passive heroism as fine. Calmly and
patiently the people bore the destruction of their
homes, the growing scarcity, the hopelessness of
victory as the toils drew ever closer round the fated
city. Six thousand women came forward to offer
their service in the hospitals. When the women of
the poor Trastevere were driven from their homes
by the French shells, the government lodged them
in the palaces of the fugitive nobles, on their simple
promise that there should be neither theft nor injury,
and the promise given in the name of "God and
the People" was scrupulously kept.</p>

<p>To their leader those weeks must have been a time
of fearful strain. Garibaldi's bad generalship and bad
temper shortened a resistance, that was hopeless from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the first. The losses were heavy, and Mameli and
Manara fell with many another of Mazzini's friends.
After the ill-fated revolt of the Mountain on June 13,
there was no hope of diversion from the republicans
at Paris. At home, though the Assembly loyally
supported him, he had to meet the petulant criticism
of Garibaldi and the intriguers who made him their
tool. To him it was a matter of clear duty that the
Republic should fight on to the end. "Monarchies
may capitulate, republics die and bear their testimony
even to martyrdom." When the last defences broke
down, he wished to make a desperate fight from street
to street, or retire with the Assembly and the army
to the Apennines, throw themselves on the Austrian
lines, and keep the republican flag flying in Romagna.
The army was prepared for either course; but the
Assembly had no stomach for the sacrifice, and Mazzini,
bitterly reproaching them, resigned his office on the
eve of the city's fall. Sullenly Rome surrendered,
and the victors, as they entered the city, hung back
before the threatening populace. Garibaldi, with three
thousand who disdained surrender, began his great
retreat. "Hunger and thirst and vigil," he promised
them, "but never terms with the enemy." Mazzini
would have been more consistent, had he gone out
with them. Perhaps he had no liking for a desperate
fragment of his rejected scheme; perhaps the personal
tension with Garibaldi was too great. For some days
he stayed on in Rome. He was worn out and
overstrung; he had not slept on a bed since the siege
began, he had fed on coarse and insufficient food.
In two short months he had grown old; his beard
was grey, his face cadaverous, his manner, so Margaret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Fuller noted, "sweet and calm, but full of a more fiery
purpose than ever." He wandered defiantly about the
streets. It was partly that he wanted, by offering
himself to any assassin's knife, to kill the lie of the
Catholic press that he had forced a hated tyranny
upon the Romans. Besides, he had a desperate hope
that he might rouse the people and the remaining
troops to one more struggle. His whole soul was
possessed by the passion to protest on to the end
against the triumph of brute force. It is strange that
the French did not arrest him; perhaps they knew
too well the temper of the people. At last Gustavo
Modena's wife and Margaret Fuller persuaded him to
withdraw. He had no passport, but he found the
means of sailing to Marseilles; there he succeeded in
eluding the French police and travelled on to Geneva.</p>

In Switzerland&mdash;Life in London&mdash;English friends&mdash;English politics and
literature&mdash;The Friends of Italy.
</p>

<p>Mazzini stayed for a few weeks in a quiet hotel near
his old quarters at Geneva, then moved to Lausanne,
where he and a few more refugees, Saffi, his co-Triumvir,
and Pisacane among them, took a small house
(the Villa Montallegro) near the town on the hills that
overlook the lake. Here he and his friends plunged
at once into the old eager work of correspondence
and journalism, as if the struggle at Rome had been a
holiday. Another ephemeral paper, <i>L'Italia del Popolo</i>,
was launched on its short career. His head was full
of literary schemes,&mdash;an Italian translation of the
Gospels with an introduction, a new Encyclopædia,
which should do for religious democracy what the old
Encyclopædia had done for the thought of the
eighteenth century. It was a quiet, not unhappy
time, that must have recalled something of the old days
at Marseilles. At times indeed he was miserable and
pessimistic as of old, brooding over lost friendships,
chafing at the triumph of brute force in Italy. But
except in these hours of taciturn gloom, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
avoided all companionship, he was serene and genial,
sometimes brightening into anecdote and humour,
when the party settled down to the evening's talk
and chess.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1850 the agitation in France
at the proposed revision of the constitution excited
vague hopes of a revolution there; and with some
fatuous idea that he could help to stop Louis
Napoleon's progress to empire, Mazzini went to Paris,
only to discover how empty was the expectation. On
the journey he lost a note-book, in which for many
years he had entered his thoughts on religion. The
world would gain more from its discovery than from
that of any lost Greek tragedy. He crossed to
England for a few months, then returned to Switzerland.
But the persecution of 1834 repeated itself.
The governments put pressure on the Swiss to expel
the refugees, and Mazzini after a month or two of
hiding found it necessary to leave. One night in
November he and two friends left Geneva, walking
along the lake to Nyon, while they discussed Byron
and Mickiewicz, and were taken on in a friend's
carriage to Lausanne, whence he found the means
to escape to England.</p>

<p>Here he made his home with few interruptions till
the last years of his life, taking no small part in
English society and politics, finding his best friends
in English men and women. "Italy is my country,
but England is my real home, if I have any," he said.
He had come to love England and English ways,
and in his brief political journeys to Italy his home
thoughts went to England, and he was glad to be
back again. His old horror of London changed to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
real liking; and its conveniences for his work made
it difficult to get him out of town, save for a rare
visit to his friends, or for a day or two to recruit his
health at St Leonard's or Eastbourne, which he liked,
or at Brighton, which he hated. He longed sometimes,
indeed, for "some secret nook in the country,
to breathe fresh air and gaze on the sky or at the sea";
but when he was urged to take rest in the country,
he railed affectionately at his "misled and dreamy
friends" for supposing he could attend to his work
anywhere out of London. The fogs still had their
fascination for him; he wrote once from Italy, "I think
very often under these radiant skies of the London
fogs and always regretfully. Individually speaking,
I was evidently intended for an Englishman."</p>

<p>At first he lived at Cromwell Lodge, Old Brompton,
a little house in the middle of orchards and gardens
at what was then the extreme western end of London.
Building operations drove him thence, and Mrs Carlyle
found him lodgings over a post-office at 15 Radnor
Street, near his old rooms in York Buildings. Here, at
first with Saffi and three other exiles, afterwards alone,
he lived the frugallest of lives. His income indeed was
somewhat larger than it had been. At his mother's
death he came into an annuity of £160 a year, which
she, knowing how readily his money flowed to public
work and charity, had wisely invested with obdurate
trustees. His friends would gladly have helped him,
but though he frankly asked money of them for his
cause (always scrupulously repaying it, if borrowed on
his personal responsibility), he never, so far as I know,
would take from this time forward money for strictly
personal needs. Once only he accepted some to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
for a private secretary, and once again for cabs, when
his friends suspected that there were plots to assassinate
him, and feared for his walking in London streets,
unprotected save by a sword-cane. Thus, even with
casual literary earnings, his income seldom reached
£200, and of this for some years £80 went to the
education of the Tencioni children, and often every
other available penny to finance his plots of insurrection.
While his enemies in Italy painted him living
in patrician luxury, he denied himself every comfort
(cigars always excepted), save the modest ones that
his friends forced on him. Money he only wanted for
his political schemes. "I have never felt so bitterly
the curse of not being rich," he wrote once, when
wanting rifles for one of his revolutionary plots. For
himself, he was content with his humble fare and modest
lodgings. Here in his small room, every piece of
furniture littered with books and papers, the air thick
with smoke of cheap Swiss cigars (except when friends
sent Havannahs), brightened only by his tame canaries
and carefully-tended plants, he was generally writing
at his desk till evening, always with more work in
hand than he could cope with, carrying on the usual
mass of correspondence, writing articles for his Italian
papers, raising public funds with infinite labour, stirring
his English friends to help the cause, finding money
and work for the poor refugees, or organizing concerts
in their interest. The school in Greville Street went on
for three years longer, when, except for the Sunday
lectures, it was closed. And amid all the exacting
cares of public work he spared himself no trouble for
his English friends, advising in their family affairs,
writing long letters of tenderness and spiritual wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to comfort a bereaved son or lead a young girl from a
life of selfishness to higher things.</p>

<p>He had aged greatly since he left London less than
three years ago. He was worn and thin, his beard
was white, and the once dark features wore "a sort
of grey, ashy halo." But it was the same high "cliff-like"
forehead, the regular features, the strong, straight
nose, "the exquisite curve of lips like a woman's in
their expression of spotless purity," the piercing black
eyes, whose like none ever knew who saw them, "of
luminous depth, full of sadness, tenderness, and courage,
of purity and fire, readily flashing into indignation or
humour, always with the latent expression of exhaustless
resolution"; "the only eyes," says another observer,
"I ever saw that looked like flames." "His face in
repose was grave, even sad, but it lit up with a smile
of wonderful sweetness, as he greeted a friend with a
pressure, rather than a shake, from the thin hand."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
He carried his head a little forward, and he had a habit
of sitting on the edge of a chair, perhaps, it has been
suggested, because in his own room his books left
but narrow margin for sedentary uses. He dressed, as
ever, with perfect neatness, in a worn black frock-coat,
a double-breasted velvet waistcoat buttoned high,
despising collars and substituting a silk handkerchief
wound round his neck, wearing a long thin gold watch
chain, which had probably been his father's, and two
rings, one at least no doubt his mother's, now rescued
from the pawn-shop.</p>

<p>His personal life was centred almost wholly in his
English friends. It is true, he felt his exile bitterly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
"Wish for me," he writes to friends one Christmas,
"that I may die in the country and for the country,
in which I have been forbidden to live." But he had
no home ties in Italy now. His father had died in the
winter of 1848, leaving him to brood over the thought
that he had been but a source of pain to the grim
old man, who under all his moroseness and want of
sympathy had never lost his pride and affection for
his son. His mother, whom he had seen once again
when at Milan, with whom he had never relaxed the
close, affectionate correspondence, died in the summer
of 1852. It was a very heavy blow. There was no
one to replace her; he had lost "the dream of his
individual life,&mdash;to see her in the joy of triumph," when
Italy was free. But he nerved himself, and took her
loss as an incentive to fresh effort. "My mother," he
writes, "seems to me to be present, perhaps nearer than
she was in her terrestrial life. I feel more and more
the sacredness of duties, which she recognized, and of
a mission which she approved. I have now no mother
on earth except my country, and I shall be true to her,
as my mother has been to me." So intensely actual
was she still to him, that once afterwards, when in
hiding and deep dejection, he thought she came to
him in veritable presence to strengthen and console
him. His lonely heart, athirst as ever for affection,
went out to his English friends, the men and still
more the women, who believed in him and in his
politics, and tried to bring some warmth and brightness
into his sad life. After a year or two he saw little
more of the Carlyles, but their place was more than
taken by the Ashursts, the Stansfelds, the Peter Taylors,
the Shaens, the Mallesons, the Nathans, the Milner-Gibsons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
When the day's work was over, he would
generally spend the evening at one or other of their
houses, most often with the Stansfelds, whose home
at Bellevue Lodge was within an easy walk from his
lodgings. Gradually he came to have a large outside
circle of acquaintances. He corresponded with Grote
and Mrs Gaskell; the Brownings, J. S. Mill, Jowett,
Swinburne, Cairnes, Miss Martineau, probably Dickens
were among the people he met.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>With these friendships a new light and happiness
came to his life. Probably, too, the consciousness
of having played a great part nobly added a new
touch of dignity and gentleness. "The indescribable
look of suffering for others," noted one who met him
now after a ten years' interval, "has disappeared,
and he is now a man full of experience, patience, and
hope." "The Roman revolution," wrote Carlyle to
Emerson, "has made a man of him,&mdash;quite brightened
up ever since." All the human sweetness in him
blossomed out. His friends provided the home care,
which he had lost, since he left his mother and
sisters at Genoa twenty years ago; and he loved
to repay them by many little marks of affection,
never forgetting birthdays, buying presents of books
and jewelry out of his slender purse, taking them
to the Opera, where his acquaintance with the great
Italian singers sometimes put boxes at his disposal.
In his evenings at the Stansfelds he was often full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of merry fun; he could tell a story well, all the
more piquantly for his Italicisms. One favourite
anecdote (he had told it to Mrs Carlyle) was how he
baffled an undertaker, who brought a coffin by mistake
to his landlady's, and refused to take it away.
"My dear," he said, no doubt with his sweet gravity,
"we have not here a dead." Or he would, when
quite alone with the family, sing to his guitar, or
finger out on it the score of some favourite opera.
His native gentleness came out in his kindness to
children and animals. He does not seem to have
been naturally very fond of children, but, when among
them, he made himself easily at home. Some French
children at a house which he visited, who got into
disgrace when Louis Blanc came to see them, were
always good with Mazzini, "because he was so kind
and never failed to enquire after the dolls." They
loved to sit and listen to his talk, not that they
understood him, but because the beautiful voice
fascinated them. With dogs and cats and birds he
was always happy. He would make one of his
hostesses angry, because he insisted on feeding her
dog at dinner. "But, my dear," he would say, "I
make Bruno happy." Ledru Rollin and he, once
talking, probably, of the European revolution, put
out their cigars, because the smoke made a dog
uncomfortable. His most constant companions were
his tame linnets and canaries. He had netting over
the windows, so that they could fly about his room
at liberty; and visitors would generally find a bird
or two perched on his head or shoulders, or hopping
among his papers, inured to the thick tobacco smoke,
in which they and he lived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>He was a brilliant talker, because he was in earnest
and his thoughts were clear, at all events to himself.
There was no trace of effort or affectation; he was
always just himself and never played a part. He
would speak with a prophet's simplicity and conviction
of his religious faith and the destinies of
man, talking vivaciously, tenaciously, passionately
sometimes, with the authority of one who had no
thought of self and had lived and suffered for his
creed. Some of his hosts were the champions of
every struggling cause, and the conversation turned
naturally to American slavery or women's rights or
nationality or cooperation. Music and poetry were
favourite subjects with him, and he would contend
pugnaciously in mock-earnestness for the superiority
of Meyerbeer over Rossini, or inveigh to his heart's
content against the abominated doctrine of "art for
the sake of art." He once, when dining with Mr
and Mrs William Shaen, forgot his dinner in his
eagerness to convert his hostess from the heresy;
and when pressed to eat, pleaded that he had something
else to do, for "here is Mrs Shaen travelling
to perdition as fast as she can, and I must save
her soul." He spoke English now well and fluently,
but,&mdash;unlike his English writing, which was rarely
unidiomatic,&mdash;with many little Italicisms. Among
those he seldom met, he was sometimes nervous and
silent; at other times, perhaps from the same nervousness,
he would monopolize the conversation, and was
remorseful afterwards. Once, many years after this
time, he met Jowett, and talked uninterruptedly for
two hours, Jowett listening silently. When Jowett
went, he observed, "he made me talk all the time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and I have no notion what he thought of it." Jowett,
made careful notes of what he said, and years afterwards
remarked, in allusion to their meeting, "Mazzini
was a man of genius, but too much under the influence
of two abstract ideas, God and the principle
of nationality." He thought, though, very highly of
him. "He was an enthusiast, a visionary," he said,
"but he was a very noble character, and had a genius
far beyond that of ordinary statesmen. Though not
a statesman, I think that his reputation will increase as
time goes on, when that of most statesmen disappears."</p>

<p>With those, who knew him well, constraining was
the influence of this man, who spoke with authority
of life and God and duty. Young people at all
events, who came under the spell of those eyes,
and heard the vibrating voice speak with passionate
earnestness of the deep things of God, felt for him
an awe and veneration, such as few, if any, of his
generation inspired. Here was one who had given
all for his ideal, who had taken poverty for his bride,
yet without self-righteousness, too sad at the world's
sin and struggle to be aught but humble; one too,
who had lived on a great stage, who was helping
to remodel Europe, a great thinker, a great moral
teacher, yet with infinite concern for the trials and
temptations of some puzzled soul. "Thou noble
Mazzini," said Clough after brief knowledge of his
life at Rome. Much deeper was the feeling of those,
who had the privilege of close companionship. And,
though, perhaps, it would be difficult to prove it, it is
probable that he has left no inconsiderable impress
on English thought. Here and there one finds
strong traces of his influence on men, who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
helped to mould the best thought among us in the
last forty years. "Mazzini is the true teacher of our
age," said Arnold Toynbee. Never, certainly, did
age more need his high idealism to teach a nobler
rule in national and private life.</p>

<p class="p2">His literary work at this time was not remarkable.
He was "still praying God to grant him, when Italy
had become a nation, two years of hermit life," when
he could write his long-cherished book on religion and
a popular history of Italian nationality. But the
hope of ever writing them was gradually fading. He
was too absorbed through all this period by political
propagandism, and in his controversial writings of
these years he is generally far from being at his best.
The latter chapters of his <i>Duties of Man</i>, however,
date from this decade. He seems, despite his busy
life, to have found a good deal of time for reading.
His writings on the Slav question are evidently
the result of careful study. Apart from political
reading, English literature seems to have claimed his
interests. Byron was still to him the greatest of
English poets, and he read Byroniana with the zest
of a devotee. He could not forgive England for her
neglect of her "only poet who will live in times to
come." "I wish," he once wrote, "I had time to
write before dying a book on Byron, and abuse all
England, a few women excepted, for the way she
treats one of her greatest souls and minds." He was
keenly interested in the controversy on Byron's treatment
of his wife, refusing to believe that the husband
was the more in fault, but owning himself too indiscriminating
an admirer to be a fair judge.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
would contrast him with Wordsworth and Coleridge,
criticizing the latter as contemplative poets, living
remote from action among their lakes and mountains,&mdash;which
proves that he had not read Wordsworth's
patriotic sonnets. He liked Chatterton in a way,
drawn doubtless to him by his sad end and de Vigny's
drama; "I have always," he writes, "had a sort of
fondness for him, as I have for crushed flowers."
Among contemporary poets Mrs Browning was probably
his favourite. He reads <i>Aurora Leigh</i>, "admiring it
very much, only wishing from time to time that she
had written it in beautiful prose than&mdash;passages excepted&mdash;in
neglected poetry." Browning himself he
is said to have read and admired. But perhaps
he alludes to him when he writes, "the form in
England begins to be systematically wrong, I
think."</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had resumed his strong interest in
English life and politics, stimulated no doubt by the
keen thinkers he moved among, but always preserving
his own original outlook. On the whole, his was not
a very appreciative criticism. Sincerely and increasingly
as he admired the freedom and seriousness of
English ways, he keenly felt the decay of our religious
life, and, what he regarded as its consequence, the
selfishness and want of principle in our foreign policy.
His knowledge of Protestantism was never very deep
or sympathetic; but he knew enough of it to apply
his own tests of religious vitality. He condemned it
for its soul-killing formalism; he showed how it
sinned against itself, when it ceased to be concerned
with men as citizens; he poured scorn on the Bible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Societies, that tried to proselytize his countrymen, and
made no sign, when he and other Italians had fought
at Rome for liberty of conscience. It was to this
want of true religion, that he charged our insular
selfishness. He detested the Cobdenites. "The 'peace-men'
have no principle." "Your Peace Societies," he
wrote in an open letter to "the people of England,"
"allowing God's law and Godlike human life to be
systematically crushed on the two-thirds of Europe,&mdash;your
<i>believers</i> in liberty as the only pledge for man's
responsibility, allying themselves with despots,&mdash;your
Christians fighting for the maintenance of Mahommedan
law on European populations,&mdash;seem to me to be the
reverse of religious." If England gave no helping
hand to the young nationalities to which belonged the
future, she would find herself in twenty years shut out
from the sympathies and alliances and markets of the
Continent. He vigorously condemned the Crimean
War, and took his stand with the few, who tried to
save England from that colossal blunder. Not that
he objected to war with the oppressor of the Poles.
But a war, which might have been a crusade for the
downtrodden peoples of the East, had ranged England,
once the champion of liberty, on the side of Turkey
and Austria. The alliance with the tyrant of Italy
and Hungary "took from the war whatever made it
sacred in the eyes of God and man." It pledged
English backing for the evilest of Continental despotisms.
It robbed the war of any principle, and
"war is the greatest of crimes, when it is not waged
for the benefit of mankind, for the sake of a great
truth to enthrone or of a great lie to entomb." He
"bowed before" the heroism of the army, "the quiet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
silent devotedness, with which the nation accepts all
the sacrifices inseparable from a war"; but "the
policy of your war," he said, "is absolutely immoral,
how can you hope for victory?" How different had
it been, had England avoided the dishonouring touch
of Austria, and sought her ally in a Polish revolution.</p>

<p>Mazzini's interest in English society and politics
was, like everything else except his friendships, turned
to the use of his own country. He expected three
results from his English propagandism,&mdash;to secure for
Italy the moral support of English opinion and the
English press, to influence the foreign policy of the
country in her favour, and to obtain money for his
insurrectionary schemes. He worked on the traditional
sympathy for Italy, and tried to turn it from
its belief in Piedmont to his own revolutionary and
democratic programme. He appealed to the anti-Papal
feeling of the country, and played on the theme
that a free Italy would allow fair play for Protestant
missions. With men of the Manchester School he
argued that free trade would follow free government;
with the working classes he spoke of the common
interests of working men the world over. His own
friends he constantly enlisted in his schemes, and made
large levies on their private purses. "It makes my hair
stand on end," said one of them&mdash;a well-known
politician&mdash;afterwards, "to think of what I did at the
suggestion of that man." Public opinion he hoped
to influence through the Society of the Friends of
Italy, founded in the autumn of 1851 by the men, who
had promoted the People's International League four
years before,&mdash;James Stansfeld, Peter Taylor, William
Ashurst, William Shaen. Some of the best English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Liberals of the day were on the committee,&mdash;William
Byles of Bradford, Joseph Cowen, George Dawson,
John Forster, W. E. Forster, J. A. Froude, G. J.
Holyoake, William Howitt, Douglas Jerrold, Walter
Savage Landor, G. H. Lewes, W. J. Linton, David
Masson, Edward Miall, Professor Newman. Mazzini
generally, if not always, spoke at their annual meetings,&mdash;with
intense nervousness, for he was not yet
sufficient master of English to speak it fluently, and
he "could not think without a pen in his hand." "I
cannot understand people," he writes, "who can prepare
a speech or article walking up and down their room
or garden. I could walk about a day without an
idea entering my head." His speeches, none the
less, seem to have been eloquent and successful, his
manner being, as the newspapers reported, "most
exciting." The Society suspended work, when the
Crimean War broke out, and was re-constituted again
at the end of 1856. As far as money went, Mazzini
got less than he hoped from his English agitation.
A few friends gave generously, but there was little
of the response that came to Garibaldi's appeal a few
years later. But the Society did much to win English
opinion, if not for Mazzini's own special schemes, at
all events for the bigger question of Italian liberty.
The <i>Leader</i>, the <i>Daily News</i>, the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>
opened their columns, and did something to counteract
the anti-Italian bias of the <i>Times</i>. In 1857 a
fairly vigorous agitation, especially in the North
and Scotland, carried on the work that Kossuth's
meetings had begun, and roused a vehement popular
feeling against Austria.</p>

Genoese plot of 1857.
</p>

<p>It is painful to turn from Mazzini in England, the
great-hearted friend, the prophetic thinker, the generous
worker in the cause of man, to his political action in
Italy. Had he yielded to the advice of some of his
friends and left politics at this time for literature, his
fame were brighter and his life more fruitful in pure
good. His work for Italy was done; he had conquered
it for more than half his creed. Half its best
men had been nurtured on his writings, had learned
from him to believe in independence and unity,
though still they spoke of unity in whispers, and
he himself knew not how far opinion had advanced.
The day of conspiracy had passed; free Piedmont
was slowly marshalling the forces of the nation for
another and decisive war. The republic became impossible
on the day, when Victor Emmanuel swore
loyalty to the constitution, and thereby proclaimed
himself champion of Italian aspirations. The one
thing needful was to rally every section of patriots to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the one possible flag. To attack the monarchy now
only hurt the bigger issue, lost sight of the great goal
in mists of schism, brought bitterness and dissension
where discipline was all important for the day of trial.
No one was more insistent than Mazzini on the need
of discipline, but in practice he conditioned it in these
years by being himself leader. One who found it
so difficult to compromise, could hardly follow.</p>

<p>Had Mazzini thought the republic the more important
issue, his action would at least have been
consistent. But he had deliberately set unity above
it, and independence from Austria above either. A
saner politician would have been silent on the minor
question. But Mazzini could never long repress his
republican teaching. It was partly that, save in
moments of comparative lucidity, he convinced himself
that Piedmont would never make a cast for unity, that
the Austrians could not be expelled but by a great
rising of the people. Had he gauged Italian sentiment
more accurately, he would have spared himself the error,
would have lost his deep distrust in Piedmont and
its king, his bitter animosity to Cavour, his pitiable
exaggeration of the strength of his own party. But
an exile lives in necessary half-knowledge. The
government of Piedmont, as exclusive and intolerant as
himself, barred from wholesome activity in his own land
the man, who, had he been at Turin in daily contact
with men of other parties, would have been a mighty
force for good; and to them, more than to Mazzini
himself, belongs the pity of his wasted patriotism.
Not but what in any circumstances Mazzini found it
hard to recognize new facts. The prophet is by nature
inflexible; and Mazzini's whole creed was a thing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
such passionate intensity, each part had twisted itself
so inextricably round the rest, that it cost a wrench
to part with any detail. "I may, of course, be
mistaken," he wrote of his political creed, "but mine
is a matter of deep conviction, and it is impossible
for me to modify or alter it." He was incapable of
taking advice; if men differed from him, he assailed
them bitterly instead of examining the reasons for their
dissent. And the partisan, that was always latent in
him, grew till it obscured the statesman. He who
was so insistent that no one had a right to set his own
opinions above the people's common sense, was the
last to bow to the popular verdict, when it declared
against himself. Henceforth Mazzini was more foe
than friend to his own ideals. Much he still did
to stir his countrymen to strenuous and high-thinking
patriotism. Though he aimed beyond their ken, he
shot more high than all the politicians. But in the
great march he broke the ranks, and made the task
more difficult for men, who, with a patriotism as true
and with a saner strategy, had set their faces for the
same high goal.</p>

<p>Retirement was however impossible for a man of
Mazzini's temperament. He was too feverishly impatient
for his country's salvation to only stand and
wait. Inaction seemed treachery to the cause of
righteousness. Both in public and private life he
insisted that "thought and action" must go hand in
hand, that a man had no right to confine his energies
to literature and decline his part in practical political
work. He criticized intolerantly the men in Italy, who
wrote patriotic literature instead of plotting insurrection.
"Actions," he said, "are the books of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
masses," especially in a country where the majority
were illiterate. He in fact, like every other patriot,
was maddened by the savage tyranny, with which the
Austrians and the Pope and the King of Naples were
scourging his unhappy country,&mdash;"the insolent triumph
of brute force, the exile and death of our brothers in
two-thirds of Europe, the long weeping of their sisters
and mothers, the lying, the espionage, the corruption,
the cry of the oppressed masses, the teaching of those
who fight and die in silence, the shame that makes us
blush for those who submit and sell themselves in
despair." "Such a state of things," he wrote to an
English friend after the Mantuan executions, "cannot
last, must not last. It is far better to die in a supreme
glorious battle, fought under the eye of God with our
national banner unfurled, than to see the best of our
land falling one by one under the axe of the executioner."
It were sin to wait, and he saw no need for
waiting. He was right of course in his belief that a
nation, which had once so nearly won its freedom,
would try for it again. "The dreams of violence," he
said, "are brief, and infallible the triumph of a people,
that hopes and fights and suffers for justice and holy
liberty." He had persuaded himself that the masses
were only waiting for a signal to rise and throw
themselves on Austria. As so often in his logic, the
thing ought to be and therefore must be. He knew
indeed that he could not count on the middle classes
for insurrection. The men, who had been the strength
of Young Italy, had gone over almost in mass to the
Piedmontese School, and he did not spare them his
reproaches. But he hoped in the working men.
While the Moderates hardly noticed them, he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
what stuff lay in the despised and misunderstood
Italian artisans. But he exaggerated his influence
with them. "They are mine, devotedly mine, to
blindness." Individuals, indeed, among them he won,
as he won men of every class, by his simple, noble
earnestness. But except in and round Genoa their
numbers at this time were few.</p>

<p>It was an impossible policy. It had nearly succeeded
in 1848, when Europe was in flames, but
Mazzini would not see how radically circumstances
had changed. There was no serious hope now that
a general movement of European democracy would
divide the forces of Austria; and his efforts to bring
together again the democrats of different countries,
especially of Italy and Hungary, had no results, at
all events till in after years. The resuscitation of
Austria, the evidence of her military strength, the
Second Empire in France, the resignation of Palmerston,
the collapse of the German democrats had killed
any early hope of a successful war, even though all
the armed strength of the nation, regular armies and
volunteers alike, were put into it. It was true that
the nation could win its freedom even now, if it
sought it at all cost, if it were willing to face the
awful sacrifice,&mdash;the mowing down of the undisciplined
levies, the wasting of the country,&mdash;and
fight through defeat to victory. But Mazzini's hopes
shipwrecked on the fact,&mdash;and bitterly he came to
recognize it,&mdash;that the Italians, like most other
peoples, were not a nation of martyr-heroes, that
the peasants had little active patriotism, that thousands
in other classes cared more for church than country,
that even among the rest there was little of the grim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
tenacity of Americans or Dutch or of the fierce unconquerableness
of Greeks and Spaniards.</p>

<p>It was this that gave the Piedmontese party its
justification. Timid and conservative as it often was,
it at all events recognized facts. It saw that this
undisciplined enthusiasm was not business, that in
the present condition of Europe another national
rising meant another and more terrible disaster, that
each little revolt with its miserable ending only
tightened the tyranny and damped the patriots, that
Piedmont's first duty was to preserve its own liberty,&mdash;no
light task in itself,&mdash;that its next was to gather
round it all the aspirations of the country, discipline
them and husband them, till the chance came
again to fight with a probability of victory. The
Piedmontese had learnt the lessons of 1848-49 very
differently from their critic. To them discipline was
the one essential. Never again must dissension
about means paralyze the country in front of the
enemy. And in the interests of union they had
small mercy for democratic theories, they were prepared
to be unfair to opponents and crush minorities.
Victor Emmanuel must be the figure-head of the
movement and the Piedmontese statesmen its leaders.
Theoretically, of course, their policy was a smaller
one than Mazzini's. It had little of the poetry and
idealism of the movement, which he had helped to
inspire. There was no majestic vision of a people
rising in its own spontaneous might and deciding
its destinies in a great national pact. It postulated
encroachments on democratic freedom. It was willing
to buy alliances by concessions, that abated the
country's dignity. It veiled the great ideal of Unity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and sought attainment by slow stages and crooked
paths. But, assuming that independence and unity
were the great essentials,&mdash;and on this the best
men of the party were at one with Mazzini,&mdash;it
was on its main lines the only possible policy. And
it was a sense of this, that rallied the great mass of
patriots to the flag of Piedmont, and left Mazzini to
protest almost alone, a leader without followers.</p>

<p>The antagonism of the two schools was typified in
Cavour and Mazzini. They were very different in
temperament:&mdash;the one an aristocrat by training, a
genial hater of theories, an opportunist content to
feel his way by little steps, to wait patiently year
after year rather than risk failure, making success
his object, with small scruple as to means or personal
honour, so his country stood to gain; the other a
man of greater nature and culture but less capacity,
democrat of democrats, distrusting king and nobles
and middle classes, passionate and outspoken in
his friendships and his enmities, the uncompromising,
inflexible, restless apostle, who would conquer armies
by a principle of abstract righteousness, too dazzled
by the future to see the mundane obstacles and
hard facts about his feet. Cavour had a supercilious
contempt for Mazzini and his doctrines; he
probably regarded him as a nuisance, and would
have gladly seen him shot. His business was to
win Italy, if he could do so without risking overmuch;
but he was minister of a crown and would
do nothing to endanger it. He had convinced himself,
save at moments of impatient optimism, that
only through a French alliance could Austria be
driven out. For this he was willing to humour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Louis Napoleon, to stoop to trickery, to be brutal
to the republicans. He would use the revolutionaries
if he could, but it must be at their own risk
and for the greater glory of the monarchy. Cavour,
hiding his ideals and working in mists of diplomacy,
chose to be misunderstood; and it is no wonder that
Mazzini generally read him on the surface, and refused
to see how much their programmes had in
common. To him Cavour's slow patient policy
came of mere weakness and inconstancy of purpose.
He thought of him as a timid diplomatist, half-leagued
with the despotisms, more careful of convention
than of right, incapable of aspiring to Italy
and Rome. It was only late in life, that he recognised
his statesmanship. He hated him as a
truckler to Napoleon; he thought that he favoured
Napoleon's cousin, Lucien Murat, for the throne of
Naples, that he held the Emperor's friendship of
more account than Italy. He never realised that
under the careful statesman lay a bold and eager
spirit, that at the fitting moment might be as revolutionary
as himself.</p>

<p>Two men of such diverse character could probably
have never worked cordially together. But under
other circumstances they might have helped and
supplemented one another. It was a cruel fate that,
owing to Mazzini's exile and the consequent impossibility
of mutual understanding, they should
have wasted so much in a bitter and unnecessary
antagonism. Mazzini no doubt had much provocation
for his fixed hostility. He, who had given all for
country, was an exile from the land he loved, seeing
it only in rare and secret visits, stealing to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
mother's grave by night "like a man bent on a
crime," his followers persecuted, his apologies suppressed.
But he painfully exaggerated the deficiencies
of the rival school. When he asked the
Piedmontese government, "Are you with Austria or
against her?" when he branded the royalists as
being, "next to Austria, the great obstacle to Italian
freedom," he showed a partisan's unwillingness or
incapacity to grasp the facts. His watch, in Giusti's
phrase, had stopped at 1848; and he could not see
how radically Cavour and the new King had changed
the spirit of Piedmontese policy. Victor Emmanuel,
he confidently asserted, though "better than his
ministers," "neither wishes to be nor can be King
of Italy"; it was "an absolute impossibility" that
he would try, unless compelled, to win Italian freedom.
Mazzini was on sounder ground, when he fulminated
against the French alliance. Others besides him
foresaw the difficulty of reconciling Louis Napoleon's
timidity with Italian aspirations, the recurring temptation
to duplicity, if Italian statesmen had to quiet
his suspicions and fears. He well said that it stained
the name of Italy to seek salvation from the man
who had crushed the Roman Republic and made the
<i>coup d'état</i>. But Mazzini never faced the hard fact,
that no otherwise could Austria be driven out. And
his blindness grew partly out of the sheer personal
hatred of the Emperor, which he did not attempt
to conceal. Only in later years he came to see at
all, and never fully, that Louis Napoleon, however
timidly, wished to remodel Europe on his own
principle of nationality. He never understood how
real was the Emperor's good-will to Italy, how far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
his foreign policy outstripped his people's. He
thought he had first-hand information as to Napoleon's
schemes, and the first-hand information was always
incomplete and misleading. Nor were his antipathies
limited to the Emperor. "My antagonism to the
French," he writes in 1850, "grows stronger every
day." He had a bitter controversy with Louis Blanc
and the French socialists. But, strangely, he had
no word of condemnation for the French Catholics,
who had prompted the expedition to Rome and
were ever pulling back Napoleon in his more generous
designs. At a later time, at all events, he quite
underrated their strength.</p>

<p>Was compromise with Piedmont impossible? Daniel
Manin, the republican Triumvir at Venice in 1849,
whose rule there stands out with Mazzini's own at
Rome as one of the most brilliant pages in the history
of the century, founded in these years a National
Society, with a unitarian but royalist programme.
He recognised with the Piedmontese politicians the
need of discipline, and that discipline could only
come by accepting Victor Emmanuel as nominal
leader. But he conditioned his conversion to royalism
by the King's acceptance of Unity. "Make
Italy," he wrote to him, "and we are with you;
if not, not." Manin hoped to win Mazzini to his
programme. He, like him, had been a republican;
he was a man of noblest private life, of sincerest
patriotism; he was striving earnestly for Unity; he
fretted almost as much as did Mazzini himself at
Cavour's slow man&oelig;uvring. Why should not Mazzini
abandon his impossible dream of the republic, and
work together for the bigger end with a man as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
democratic as himself? Mazzini refused. All that
he would offer was "the neutral flag" of 1848,&mdash;a
promise to leave the settlement of the question
between monarchy and republic to a future Constituent
of the freed nation. The position was
plausible enough, but there were fatal objections to
it. It encouraged the federalists to agitate; it must
necessarily alienate the King; it would make discipline
more difficult than ever. And, when the
country, as Mazzini himself began to recognise, was
declaring unmistakably for the monarchy, to keep
the question nominally open was a homage more to
the letter than to the spirit of popular sovereignty.</p>

<p class="p2">As a kind of appendix to the controversy, Mazzini
had his famous argument with Manin on "the theory
of the dagger." In 1856 Manin wrote an open letter,
attacking the theory as "the great enemy of Italy."
He sent his letter to the <i>Times</i>, provoking Mazzini's
retort that his "sense of personal dignity and respect
for his country should have prevented him from
writing to such a paper." Manin did not specifically
mention Mazzini, but the reference was understood,
and Mazzini indignantly replied. It is hardly necessary
to-day to answer the charge that Mazzini encouraged
political assassination. He held indeed that
there were rare occasions when it was right,&mdash;"exceptional
moments in the life and history of nations,
not to be judged by normal rules of human justice,
and in which the actors can take their inspiration only
from their conscience and God." Tyrannicide was
justifiable, when it was the only means, and the
successful means, of staying an intolerable oppression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
It was a commonplace to glorify Judith and Brutus and
Charlotte Corday; it was hypocrisy, he said, begging
his own postulates, to condemn for the same actions
the men who tried to kill Louis Napoleon or Ferdinand
of Naples.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In every other case he "abominated"
political assassination. It is, he says, "a crime, if
attempted with the idea of revenge or punishment; a
crime when there are other roads to freedom open;
culpable and mistaken, when directed against a man,
whose tyranny does not descend into the grave with
him." When, for instance, Cavour charged him with
plotting to kill Victor Emmanuel, he indignantly replied
that the King's life was "protected, first by the existence
of a constitution, next by the uselessness of
the crime." With one exception only, he was loyal
to his profession. Young Italy explicitly abandoned
the Carbonaro tradition of assassinating traitors, and
so far as its founder could control the society, it never
sinned against the precept. The forged charge of
the French government in 1833 that he ordered the
murder of some spies at Rodez was amply exposed,
when Sir James Graham repeated it in 1845, though
the Paris correspondent of the <i>Times</i> was not ashamed
to drag the libel up again nineteen years afterwards.
When Triumvir at Rome, Mazzini vigorously repressed
the assassinations there and at Ancona. He was
absolutely ignorant of Orsini's attempt to assassinate
Louis Napoleon, though he disdained to defend himself
from the suspicion of complicity, partly because
he scorned the puny libellers of the press, partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
because "Europe needed a bugbear to frighten it
and his name would do as well as any other." The
charges that he was privy to Tibaldi's and Greco's
plots against the Emperor were certainly in the latter
case, and almost as certainly in the former, inventions
of the French police. Late in life, he vigorously discouraged
plots to assassinate the Pope and Victor
Emmanuel, and stopped another to explode six bombs
at a ball given at Venice by the Austrian Viceroy. In
one case only&mdash;in early life&mdash;Mazzini was in some
sense an accomplice in an assassination plot. In the
midst of the preparations for the Savoy raid, a young
Corsican, Antonio Gallenga,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who afterwards settled in
England and was for some time special correspondent
of the <i>Times</i> in Italy, came to him with a plan to
assassinate Charles Albert in revenge for the Genoese
executions. Mazzini tried to dissuade him, but at last
persuaded himself that Gallenga was an appointed
agent of Providence "to teach despots that their life
may depend on the will of a single man." He gave
Gallenga the means of travelling to Turin and sent
him a dagger; but he seems to have given little more
thought to the matter, perhaps concluding on reflection
that, as proved to be the case, Gallenga had no
stuff in him for the business.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Manin's indictment aimed equally at the use of the
knife in popular insurrections. Mazzini's answer here
was easier but less ingenuous in its applications. It
was cant, he properly replied, to call it no murder, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
a soldier shot an enemy with his rifle, and murder, if
an artisan conspirator stabbed an Austrian soldier
with the only weapon he possessed. Unfortunately
he weakened his argument by extending this theory
of "irregular warfare" to cases, like those of Rossi or
Marinovich, where men had been killed treacherously
in revolutionary times for political or private vengeance.
Perhaps he was defiantly exaggerating, for before this
he had strongly reprobated Rossi's murder; probably
he did not know the facts of Marinovich's case. It
would at all events be very hard to justify him, when
he commissioned Orsini to find men to surprise and
kill the Austrian officers at Milan as the first step in
an insurrection. It was no lower in its ethics than
some established rules of war, but it came sadly below
his own more noble estimate of the sacredness of
human life.</p>

<p class="p2">While Mazzini's theories kicked against the pricks,
his political work of these years is a pitiable tale of
noble effort all in vain, of high purpose spoilt by
obstinacy and incapacity. In the autumn of 1850 he
founded a National Italian Committee, which claimed
to be a kind of legal successor to the Assembly of the
Roman Republic. Practically, though not ostensibly,
it was a republican organisation. "The manifesto is
moderate," Mazzini wrote privately to Italy, "but
behind the manifesto am I, which means, I think, the
republic." The ambiguity doomed it from the start.
The straiter republicans attacked it as departing from
the faith. The much vaster host of democrats, who were
learning to believe in the Piedmontese monarchy, held
carefully aloof. Others revolted at Mazzini's "intolerable
dictatorship"; and the charge was half a true one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
He proudly and sincerely replied to the taunt of
personal ambition, but now, as always, he exacted an
impossible obedience from his fellow-workers. In
Italy the society found a certain following; and
Mazzini boasted half-seriously to his friends that the
republican flag would be flying on the Quirinal next
year. But outside some of the Lombard towns the
movement had little real strength; its organisation
was too loose to be effective; and one by one the exiles
on the Committee drifted away, till in 1853 it died a
natural death. The same fate befell a "National
Loan," which he had started with the ambitious hope
of raising an adequate fund for insurrection. He
issued bonds, which were to be honoured by the future
Italian state. It was to be "the first act of a financial
war, which would prove that the few monarchical or
aristocratic possessors of big capitals can be matched
by the collective power of the small capitals of democracy."
Apparently a good many of the bonds were
taken up in Italy, but the money they brought in
seems to have been soon exhausted in the expenses of
agitation and conspiracy.</p>

<p>Up to this time Mazzini had been inclined to
postpone insurrection, till, at all events in his own
judgment, it had a fair prospect of success. Unluckily
at this moment he was approached by a revolutionary
society among the artisans at Milan. He was hesitating
whether to encourage them to action, when the
ruthless execution by the Austrians of some conspirators
at Mantua maddened the men, and they decided on
revolt whether he supported them or not. He was
very anxious about the scheme and far from hopeful,
but he was too generous and impatient to refuse help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
now. He did what he could to find them money and
sympathisers, and late in 1852 he went in disguise
to Locarno to complete the preparations. The rising
was fixed for the Carnival on February 6, and on
the eve of it Mazzini was on the frontier at Chiasso,
ready to go on to Milan, as soon as the call came.
Had the rising been better organized, it had some small
chance of success. As it was, Mazzini learnt at Chiasso
that it had smoked itself out in a confused and bloody
scuffle. The business was disastrous to him, and he
came out with reputation badly damaged. The responsibility
was fixed on him, and he accepted it, though
he had only been drawn into a plan that others
made. His friends in Italy had published a two-years-old
appeal from Kossuth urging the Hungarian regiments
in the garrison to revolt, and whether or not
Kossuth authorized its publication now, had made
unjustifiable alterations in the wording. Mazzini was
responsible, if at all, only in not taking precautions
to prevent the issue, but he did not make matters
better, when he pleaded that men, who were risking
their lives for their country, were "not amenable by
strictly punctilious rules of normal times."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The fatuousness
and mismanagement of the whole business,
the pity of the wasted lives, a feeling that these ill-judged
risings hindered the cause and damaged it in
the eyes of Europe, hastened the stampede from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
own party. He still kept a considerable though
reduced hold on the artisans in a few towns of the
North, but among the middle classes his following
shrank to nearly nothing.</p>

<p>Even he almost despaired. He felt himself "accursed
by all," the "scapegoat on whom all the faults of
Israel will be heaped with a curse." The Piedmontese
press loaded him with shameful scurrility; and there
seems to have been an attempt to assassinate him.
He fretted with the sense of failure, with something
like remorse at the sufferings of the conspirators under
the Austrians' brutal vengeance. But instead of taking
the moral of the failure home, he broke into invective
against the Piedmontese, and only plunged more
desperately into schemes of insurrection. He had
been misled into suspecting an understanding between
France and Piedmont to create French protectorates
in the South and Centre; and he was eager to checkmate
it by forcing on the movement for unity and
a revolutionary war with Austria. He had two main
plans of operation. For one, the revolutionising of
South Italy, he could, though anxious for immediate
action, at present only sow the seed. The other was
to organise guerilla fighting in the Alps and Northern
Apennines and encourage the Lombard cities to revolt.
He had persuaded himself that the fast-maturing
Eastern question gave a favourable chance of attacking
Austria. Her policy of see-saw between the Western
Powers and Russia had won her the ill-will of both
sides, and she had been obliged to denude her Italian
garrisons to concentrate troops on the Russian frontier.
Mazzini had vague hopes, too, of help from America.
Kossuth's lecturing tour in the States in 1852 had excited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
an angry feeling against Austria. The American
government was irritated by the unfriendly attitude of
France and England, and perhaps had its designs on
Cuba; and Mazzini hoped that it would encourage
the revolutionary forces in Europe, in order to keep
the Powers occupied at home. George N. Sanders,
the American Consul in London, gave a dinner to him
and Kossuth and Ledru Rollin, and healths were drunk
to a future alliance of America with a federation of the
free peoples of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Mazzini's hopes were high. He
studied military maps with Kossuth and Ledru Rollin
at St John's Wood. He went to Paris and Italy in
1854 in disguise, probably spending most of his time
at Genoa, and perhaps on his way paying a visit to
Giuditta Sidoli, now silver-haired, and sweet and gracious
as ever. His movements worried all the police of Italy
and France and Switzerland, and his secret journeys
had their romance of clever disguises and audacious
escapes. A popular rhyme of the time, attributed to
Dall'Ongaro, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Where is Mazzini? Ask the pines</p>
<p>Upon the Alps and Apennines.</p>
<p>He is, wherever traitors cower</p>
<p>In terror for their fatal hour;</p>
<p>Where'er men wait impatiently</p>
<p>To give their blood for Italy.</p>
</div>

<p>Mazzini wrote home to England that the people were
fretting for action, and would have risen already, "had
he not been exceptionally prudent and calm"; in two
months more he hoped to have sapped the influence
of the royalists, and then "the field will be mine." In
August he was in the Engadin, arranging for insurrection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in the Valtellin and the Como hill country. But
the Swiss police broke up the conspirators, and Mazzini
narrowly escaped capture as he came by the Julier
diligence to Chur.</p>

<p>His hopes of Austrian isolation were soon dashed.
Austria nominally joined the Western alliance, and
Piedmont followed her into it and sent a contingent to
the Crimea. He was bitterly disappointed, and relieved
himself in angry criticisms on English and Piedmontese
policy. Against Piedmont he turned with sheer
passionate bitterness. Cavour's adhesion to the
alliance puzzled his own followers; and even now it is
not easy to be sure as to its wisdom, still less as to its
morality. But at all events everyone else recognised
that the Crimea was intended to be "the road to
Lombardy." Mazzini, blinded by his partisanship, saw
only proof that Cavour's sympathies were more with
the oppressors than the oppressed.</p>

<p>For the moment all seemed to him a hopeless blank.
His soul was "wasting in a decline," and he longed to
find mechanical work to drug the pain, or break into
some desperate action. "I am dreaming of, raving,
raging about action, physical action," he wrote. "I
am sick of the world and all its concerns, and want to
<i>protest</i>." "Literally," he wrote to another friend, "life
weighs on me. My feeling towards my country, right
or wrong, is intolerable. If I were younger, I would
be on a mountain to protest, with twenty or thirty
more. As I am, I can only eat myself away, and
pretend to smile, to avoid torturing others." Next
year (1856) his hopes suddenly revived. There
seemed a chance that Cavour would secretly assist an
insurrection against the Duke of Modena in the Carrara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
country. Through this and the two following years
the premier had intermittent plans to foment a rising
there, which would lead to annexation of the borderland,
or be twisted into a <i>casus belli</i> with Austria and
force Louis Napoleon to send his army across the
Alps. He allowed Mazzini to visit Genoa, and carried
on communications with him there. What were the
details of the plot, we have no means of knowing;
but at all events it was impossible to come to terms.
"The Piedmontese government," Mazzini wrote to
England, "are a plague. I am indirectly in contact
with them and trying all sorts of concessions, but it
is of no use. My own position is extremely delicate
and difficult between their party and the extreme
men of our own. I have now sent a sort of ultimatum
to them, which will compromise them, if accepted, or
leaves me free, if not." When the rupture came, he
turned to his plans for revolutionising the South.
For two years past he had been industriously connecting
the threads of conspiracy, that Crispi and
others had laid in Sicily and Naples. He had met
Garibaldi in London, and discussed plans with him
for an expedition to the island; and Garibaldi had
promised to go, if the Sicilians revolted and Cavour
was willing to cooperate. Again there seemed a hope
that the premier would secretly assist. Every patriot
saw the danger of Napoleon's fitful scheme to put his
cousin, Lucien Murat, on the throne of Naples; and
Cavour, though he dared not openly oppose, would
gladly see the scheme checkmated, and he had his
own plans for adding Sicily to Victor Emmanuel's
kingdom. He seems to have promised funds for
Mazzini's design, but again from some unexplained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
cause he drew back. Mazzini refused to give up his
scheme, and indeed the Genoese conspirators were too
impatient for action to desist, whether he wished it
or not. He went to England to raise money for the
project, and returned to Genoa to mature it. Carlo
Pisacane, his friend and fellow-exile, a Neapolitan
duke with socialist theories that little accorded with
his own, was to seize a steamer plying between Genoa
and Sardinia, and make for Calabria, there to join
hands with the insurgents in the South and raise the
country in the name of Unity. The plot was linked
to a more questionable plan. It was proposed that
the conspirators, who stayed behind, should seize the
forts at Genoa and Leghorn and obtain munitions to
send on to Pisacane. Mazzini realised the peril of
the business, the risk of civil war, the certainty that
the movement would be understood as one for the
republic rather than for unity. But he easily allowed
himself to be persuaded into it. It would, he thought,
at all events prove the solidarity of North and South,
force on a war with Austria, and prevent the French
alliance; and he had a hardly avowed hope that the
movement might after all make for a republic. So,
taking careful precautions to avoid reprisals on the
Genoese conservatives, and prevent if possible a conflict
with the troops, he threw himself into the mad
plot. Pisacane seized the <i>Cagliari</i>, and went to his
doom. Mazzini, finding that the government had
scent of the design on the forts, tried to stop it
at the last moment; but it was too late, and the
fatuous attempt ended in some street fighting and a
little loss of life. The government struck at its
fellow-conspirators of a few months back with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
severity, that did little credit to its honesty. It
deliberately misrepresented the movement as anarchist.
Mazzini and five more, who escaped, were sentenced
in contumacy to death; others were sent to long
terms of imprisonment. Mazzini took refuge in the
house of the Marquis Ernesto Pareto, a relative of
the minister of 1848, who concealed him successfully,
though the police searched his house and probed the
mattresses and the Marchioness' wardrobes with their
swords. The story went that Mazzini, disguised as
a footman, opened the door to the police-officer
who proved to be an old school-fellow and probably
recognised him. Some days after he walked out
of the house without disguise, arm-in-arm with a
Genoese lady, asked the sentry for a light for his
cigar, and drove away unsuspected to Quarto, where
he remained in safe hiding, till the news of Pisacane's
disaster reached him.</p>

The war of 1859&mdash;At Florence&mdash;Plans for the South&mdash;Garibaldi's
Expedition&mdash;Projected raid into Umbria&mdash;At Naples.
</p>

<p>Mazzini returned to England, weary and sad, but
not discouraged, and convinced that success was only
a question of opportunity and management. He
recognised how strongly the tide was setting towards
the royalists, but he still thought he had the working
classes with him. Cavour's double play and the cruel
repression of the Genoese plot left him bitterer than
ever against the monarchy and its men. "I have
never loved you," he wrote in an open letter to the
premier; "now I despise you." He attacked more
angrily still the fast-cementing alliance with France.
The Emperor was maturing his plans to drive the
Austrians out of Italy. It was not, as Mazzini
thought, mere policy alone that moved him. No
doubt, his waning prestige at home, and the fear
that another Orsini might arise, both had their
influence; but he was still true in a way to his
nationalist ideals, and since he had sacrificed Poland
to the Russian alliance, he was the more eager to
free Italy and Hungary. Mazzini, through his private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
channels of information, was among the first to have
an inkling of the compact between Cavour and the
Emperor at Plombières, but, as usual, his information
was inaccurate. He believed, quite wrongly, as we
know now, that they had agreed to leave Venetia
to Austria and give Central Italy to Prince Napoleon,
and that Cavour had offered to surrender the parliamentary
liberties of Piedmont as the price of Lombardy;
he had no knowledge that Napoleon had
promised that half the Pope's territory should pass
to Victor Emmanuel's crown.</p>

<p>Events moved fast. In the spring of 1859, thanks
to Cavour's unscrupulous but supremely skilful
diplomacy, war was imminent, and all Italy was
fretting for it. Cavour was hardy and shrewd enough
to use the revolutionary elements, on whose value
Mazzini had laid insistent stress. The volunteers
flocked to Piedmont with Garibaldi for their general,
and, except for Mazzini and Crispi and a stranded
handful, the republicans declared definitely for Victor
Emmanuel's leadership. Even Mazzini was sometimes
carried by the tide. He told his English
friends that royalists and republicans were aiming
equally at Unity; he appealed to the Piedmontese
statesmen to pronounce for the greater policy, and
if the French alliance broke down, he was prepared
to support them. But he could not reconcile himself
to the hated Emperor's help. Shutting his eyes to
the hard facts, he thought that Piedmont could defeat
Austria with no other allies than the hesitating
revolutionaries of Hungary. To ask assistance from
a despot blighted the country's self-respect; to win
its freedom, save by its own unaided strength, dishonoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
it at the birth; and it were small gain to
change the tyranny of Austria for the domineering
patronage of France. "I am equally hostile to
Austria and to Napoleon," he wrote; "and my
double aim is to get rid, if possible, of both." When
war was declared, Cavour and he both said, "the
die is cast"; Cavour added, "we have made history,"
Mazzini "we are beaten." But when the fighting
began, when, in spite of his previsions, the enthusiasm
swept through the land, and for a moment Louis
Napoleon was, next to the king and Garibaldi, the
hero of his countrymen, he could not hold back. Be
it right or wrong, the best must be made of the war;
it might yet, in the end, make Italy. Modena and
Parma, Romagna and Tuscany had driven out their
princes and declared for Victor Emmanuel's rule.
While the armies were winning Lombardy and
Venetia, he wished to see the popular forces overrun
all the Centre and make an end of the Temporal
Power. He appealed to his friends at Naples to
revolutionise the South, though he urged that they
should not annex themselves to Piedmont, while the
war lasted. After Solferino he was very hopeful.
"The Austrian domination in Italy," he said, "is at
an end."</p>

<p>Suddenly came the great betrayal of Villafranca.
Louis Napoleon, afraid of defeat in Venetia, afraid
of an attack from Prussia, repentant of his promises
to Cavour, made peace with Austria, and abandoned
Venetia to the enemy and Central Italy to the
fugitive princes. Mazzini took credit for prophesying
it; and what came of the Emperor's timidity and
the real difficulties of the situation, he regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the pre-determined treachery of Plombières. Relying
again on his imperfect private information, he thought
he had discovered an understanding between France
and Russia to partition Europe into spheres of influence,
and that Villafranca was a prelude to a triple
alliance of the three Empires. He fulminated against
"the European <i>coup d'état</i>"; he appealed to English
fears, and preached a league of England, Prussia,
and the smaller states in defence of Italian freedom.
At home he urged a truce to party feeling and the
completing of the work in despite of France and
Austria. He voiced the feeling of the country.
Cavour had resigned in hot anger at the Emperor's
desertion; but his influence was still very powerful,
and he and the King and the men, who were
at the head of affairs at Florence and Modena, were
no less determined than the democrats that at least
Central Italy should be saved. All through the
autumn their obstinate stand baffled the Emperor's
half-hearted veto, and pushed on the feeble men,
who now held office at Turin. The key of the
position was at Florence, and Ricasoli, the stark
Tuscan baron, who was practically dictator there,
believed with a faith as fearless as Mazzini's own
that Italian Unity, pregnant with mighty issues for
the world, was written in the decrees of God. He
too detested Napoleon, and was determined not to
flinch for all his threats.</p>

<p>Mazzini hurried to Florence, and arrived there
early in August. The Piedmontese government, to
its shame, had excluded the greatest of living Italians
from the amnesty, which it granted at the beginning of
the war; but Ricasoli allowed Mazzini to remain unmolested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
on his parole that his presence at Florence
should not be publicly known. There was not a little
in common between the two men,&mdash;both stainless in
their private lives, brave, honest, single-minded patriots.
They were, indeed, too uncompromising to work together;
but they sincerely respected each other, and
Ricasoli had none of the narrowness, that made the
Turin statesmen shrink from contact with a democrat.
Mazzini's policy was the same as it had been during
the war. The people must make the movement as
far as possible their own. He addressed to them a
rhapsodical appeal to nerve themselves for the great
work. "You are called," he said, "to a task like the
tasks of God, the creation of a people." The free
provinces of the Centre must hold fast to their freedom.
Louis Napoleon, he knew, could not enforce his veto;
the Powers would accept accomplished facts; the
danger of an Austrian attack he said little of. At
heart, though, he knew that the perils were thicker
than he publicly owned, and he confessed in private
letters that "the position was more than difficult,"
that, if the suggested Congress of the Powers met and
declared in favour of the exiled princes, Italy could
only make an ineffectual "protest in action." He
almost hoped that Napoleon would use force after all,
and that a war with France would come to simplify
the situation.</p>

<p>With a good deal of hesitation, he was prepared to
support annexation to Piedmont. He promised to
foment no republican agitation, so long as the royalists
marched towards Unity; and he wrote the King an
irritating but dignified appeal to have done with the
subserviency to France and bid openly for the crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
of Italy. "The day you speak this language," he
said, "parties will disappear; there will be only two
living forces in Italy,&mdash;the People and yourself." He
does not seem however to have really expected to win
him. "The King," he wrote privately in reference to
the letter, "is wavering and weak, but on him I did
not reckon." Victor Emmanuel appears, though, to
have read the appeal and taken it to heart, and
perhaps it had its influence on the events that followed.
Mazzini's supreme aim was to spread the movement
for Unity. If the government would not act, the
people must do the work themselves. He wanted to
make Tuscany and Romagna the base for an invasion
of the Pope's remaining territory; and then&mdash;onward
to Naples and the South. The hope was shared by
all the democrats and many of the moderates; but
with Mazzini it meant something even more than
Unity. It meant the triumph of religious liberty at
Rome, the downfall of "the Vicar of the Genius of
Evil," the chance that on the wreck of the Papacy
Rome would send forth the gospel of the new religion.
"The liberty of Rome," he wrote, "is the liberty of
the world. If Rome revolts, she must proclaim the
victory of God over Idols, of eternal Truth over
Falsehood, the inviolability of the human conscience."
He urged his English and German friends to stir
public opinion against the French occupation of Rome,
and put pressure on Napoleon in the name of the
principle of non-intervention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he sent his agents to prepare a Sicilian
rising, and agitated feverishly for an advance of
Garibaldi and the troops of the Central States into
Umbria, which the Papal volunteers had recovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
from the nationalists. He had thoughts of leading the
invasion himself, but he feared that his name "would
frighten the mass of the people," and he humoured
Garibaldi by promising to make him the hero of the
movement and "abdicating my own individuality,
which is the easiest part." He won Farini, the
dictator of Modena, once a member of Young Italy,
to countenance the raid. He tried to win Ricasoli, but
Ricasoli, though he had threatened to join hands with
Mazzini rather than let Tuscany lose its freedom,
knew that the dangers of a forward movement were
too great at present, that if the Pope were attacked,
the outcry of Catholic Europe would compel Napoleon
to withdraw his indispensable, however irritating,
patronage, and that Italy would find herself caught in
a hopeless single-handed fight with Austria. His own
strong will and the King's common-sense stopped
Garibaldi's projects. Mazzini, ignorant of the real
position, underrated the difficulties in the way; he
never realised the strength of Catholic opinion, he
thought that Austria was not in a position to fight,
or that, if she did, it meant an uprising of all Italy
and her eventual defeat. He charged the King's veto
to mere truckling to Napoleon. But he felt his own
powerlessness. He was incensed by the harshness,
with which the government had treated some of his
friends, by the intolerance that drove himself to live
in hiding. "To be a prisoner among our own people
is too much to bear." "I have never," he wrote, "felt
so wretched and worn out in mind and soul as at
certain moments now." Ricasoli intimated that he
must leave Tuscany, and hopeless of doing any good
there, he left for Lugano and returned to England at
the end of the year.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>His ideas had passed to men more competent to
execute them. In January Cavour was again prime
minister, resolute to have Unity with Rome for the
capital, prepared, if the Emperor deserted him, to attack
Austria, rouse Hungary in her rear, and, so he hoped
in sanguine moments, "go to Vienna." But he knew
how heavy was the stake, and he would keep the
Emperor's protection if he could. When he found
that Napoleon would guarantee the annexation of the
free provinces at the price of Nice and Savoy, he
sadly and reluctantly consented to the humiliating
bargain. Mazzini read him by his despatches, and
knew nothing of his real ambitions. He thought that
the premier was opposed to Unity, even to the annexation
of Tuscany, that he clung to the French
alliance to safeguard himself from democracy at home.
He was indignant at the cession of Savoy, bartered
without reference to the wishes of its people, still
more at the desertion of Italian Nice. He was eager
to drive from office the man, on whom depended the
attainment of his hopes. He was right, however, in
thinking that Cavour could not initiate the revolution
in the South, that the government would only follow
up what the free lances began; and he was willing to
make the road easier for it, by promising, when revolution
broke out in the South, to support annexation
to Piedmont and leave Rome alone for the present.
He was persuaded that Austria would not attack, and
that the Bourbon army would dissolve or join the
insurgents.</p>

<p>The programme seemed so simple, that he hoped
to unite all the democrats upon it. But the saner
men among them saw that, as usual, Mazzini had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
underrated the danger. They knew that it meant
harder fighting than he supposed, and they dreaded a
repetition of his earlier ill-starred risings. They insisted
that, if the volunteers went to Sicily, Garibaldi
must lead them and Cavour's moral support must
be secured. Mazzini was ready to welcome Garibaldi's
leadership, though there was no very cordial feeling
between them; but he knew how reluctant Garibaldi was
to go, and he refused to let the movement hang on any
one man's action. Early in March, while Garibaldi
was still hesitating,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he sent Rosalino Pilo, a young
Sicilian noble, to lead the insurgents in the island,
spending every available shilling of his own in the
preparations. He was terribly overwrought and excited,
for he must have realised something of the
tremendous danger and responsibility; and he
travelled to Lugano to be nearer the scene of action.
There he learnt that his long efforts had had their
fruit, that the impatience he had done so much to
rouse had borne down Garibaldi's doubts, and that
he and his Thousand had started for Sicily. "God be
praised," he wrote, "Italy is not dead." When the
news came of Garibaldi's victory at Calatafimi, "Sicily
saves us," he said, "Italy will be."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>On May 7, two days after Garibaldi started, he arrived
at Genoa, still compelled to live in hiding, and able to see
his friends only by night. Characteristically, he amused
himself in leisure moments by taming sparrows, which
came to him at meal-times, followed by two hens ("I
have always been fond of hens," he writes), "whom I
feed after dinner, sometimes with bread and wine to
strengthen their constitutions against shocks and adversities."
He was not welcomed by the men who had
organised the expedition, and he found himself regarded
as "a self-intruding man," he who was ever ready to take
the risk and give others the honour, who was bracing his
frail body only by sheer sense of duty. "God knows,"
he wrote, "that morally and physically exhausted as
I am, everything I do is a real effort." But the suspicion
of his motives was inevitable. Absolutely disinterested
as he was, ever ready to spend and be
spent, he was again playing an ill-informed and
equivocal part, thrusting in his unwise projects among
the well-laid schemes of shrewder men; and those
who had organised Garibaldi's movement with consummate
skill&mdash;Bertani and Medici and Bixio&mdash;felt
that his independent action might spoil the game.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
He clung to his insensate prejudice against Cavour, at
a time when Cavour,&mdash;with whatever lapse of political
morality,&mdash;was straining every nerve to back Garibaldi
and win all Italy. In his persistent distrust of the
government and its connections with the Emperor, he
wanted to act independently of though not in hostility
to the monarchy, and while he urged annexation
in Sicily to checkmate the separatists in the island,
he was eager to prevent it on the mainland, and reserved
his freedom to preach his own doctrines there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
While Garibaldi snatched victory after victory against
tremendous odds in Sicily, he was planning a raid
into Papal territory, more or less under his own
direction; his volunteers, he hoped, would not only
free the rest of Central Italy and attack the Bourbons
from the North, but would create an influence, independent
alike of Cavour and Garibaldi, which might
perhaps in the chapter of accidents upset the monarchy,
or at least compel it to break with France. He did
not suspect how perilous the situation was, that it
was still only Louis Napoleon's protection, that stood
between Italy and a terrible conflict with Austria in
the North and Bourbons in the South, with utter
disaster as its almost certain sequel. Ricasoli and, it
seems, the King<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> gave some countenance to the raid,
for which Mazzini and Bertani were, with Garibaldi's
approval, completing the preparations. But Cavour
knew that it meant the forfeiture of the Emperor's
friendship, and arranged with Bertani, who was
throughout lukewarm for the scheme, terms which
would at all events save his own credit with the
Emperor. The force, which had been destined for
the Papal coast, sailed to join Garibaldi in Sicily.
Mazzini either did not know of the agreement or
refused to be bound by it; he went to Florence, where
another body of volunteers was waiting in the neighbourhood
ready to cross the frontier, and intended to
lead them to a desperate attack on Perugia. Cavour
insisted that the men should be disbanded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Ricasoli, tempering the premier's orders, persuaded
them to go to Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Less than a month after, the Piedmontese declared
war against the Pope, and Fanti,&mdash;Mazzini's follower
once in the days of the Savoy raid,&mdash;overran such of
the Pope's remaining territory as was not occupied by
the French. Garibaldi, victoriously advancing from
the South, had entered Naples, and save for Rome
and its neighbourhood and a small district held by
the remnants of the Bourbon army, all the Centre and
the South were free. Austria, frightened by Napoleon's
threats, had been a passive spectator, while her allies
were crushed. Italian Unity was nearly won, but the
splendid consummation was dashed by the dread of
civil strife. Garibaldi, careless of obstacles, was impatient
to march on to Rome; Cavour knew that
that meant war with France and would have it at no
cost. Crispi and Bertani were trying to organise the
South in an opposition to Cavour and his party, that
might easily take a republican colour. Mazzini went
to Naples, and warmly backed them. He urged
Garibaldi to go on, though by preference to Venice
rather than to Rome, for he saw now almost as acutely
as Cavour did the danger of a conflict with France.
If Garibaldi advances, he wrote to England, "we shall
have Unity within five months; if he does not, we
shall have slumber, then anarchy, then&mdash;a little later&mdash;Unity."
He appealed to the Neapolitans to save the
principle of popular sovereignty by conditioning their
annexation to Victor Emmanuel's crown with the
stipulation that an Italian National Assembly should
meet to draw up a new constitution. The cry was a
futile and dangerous one, for the mass of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
were impatient for annexation on any terms; and
with trouble threatening the young country on every
side, it were madness to throw its future into the
melting-pot of the constitution-mongers. It was easy
to paint Mazzini as an enemy of Unity; and a
Neapolitan mob shouted 'death' under the windows
of the man, who had given everything for them.
Pallavicino, the pro-dictator, Manin's old co-worker
and Garibaldi's friend, courteously appealed to him to
leave. "Even against your wish," he said, "you
divide us." Mazzini refused to waive an Italian's right
to live on Italian soil; and he was molested no more.
Garibaldi indignantly intervened on his behalf; the
King probably protected him. "Leave Mazzini alone,"
he had said, "if we make Italy, he is powerless; if we
cannot, let him do it, and I will be <i>Monsù Savoia</i> and
clap my hands for him." But Mazzini was bitterly
pained and weary of it all. "I am worn out morally
and physically," he wrote; "for myself the only really
good thing would be to have unity achieved quickly
through Garibaldi, and one year before dying of
Walham Green<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> or Eastbourne, long silences, a few
affectionate words to smooth the ways, plenty of sea-gulls,
and sad dozing." Early in November, after a
friendly interview with Garibaldi, at which they laid
their schemes for winning Rome and Venice, he left
Naples.</p>

</p>

<p>Mazzini's remaining life is one of melancholy pathos.
He could not rest, till Unity was accomplished. Aged
and often very ill and suffering, longing for quiet and
literature, he braced his frail body and unhappy
soul to the fret and weariness and disillusioning of
politics. Could one be sure that it profited country
or mankind, one would rest content, knowing that
he had chosen the hard path and never flinched.
But it was&mdash;at all events in the near results&mdash;a
grievous waste. Those splendid faculties were worn,
as he would sometimes own himself, in rolling the
stone of Sisyphus. Had he given these years to the
book on religion, that he ever kept in mind, to building
up "the church of the precursors," he might perhaps
have done a thing yet greater than the making
of Italy. His political work henceforth was mostly
thrown away; for, as he said, his star was the Dog,
and his business "to bark, generally without being
heard." Gloriously right in his ideals, he marred it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
all by ignorance of facts. His nearer vision failed
in blinding partisanship, in his obdurate hatred of
Louis Napoleon and suspicion of the Italian statesmen.
He could not see that the royalists were aiming
at Unity almost as seriously and more wisely than
himself, that Louis Napoleon wished to be his country's
friend, and that the Emperor's hesitations and backslidings
were concessions to the relentless pressure
of Catholic opinion. He could not escape from his
own past, he had a feverish, unreasoned craving for a
single form of action, he could not see that conspiracy
and insurrection, which had their justification and
chance of success twenty years ago, had neither now.
It is perhaps never easy for one man to be both
idealist and statesman,&mdash;for Mazzini, with his passion
and inflexibility, least of all. He could not leave it
to other men to achieve his ideals in their own way.
He had a dangerous belief that he had "the instinct
of the situation," and would never own in politics that
others might have their fragment of the truth. This
obstinate rebellion&mdash;covert or open&mdash;against the verdict
of his countrymen,&mdash;was it the heroism of the
one righteous man, or was it, as one of his old
friends called it, "a huge egotistical presumption?"
Or was it rather the noble error of one, who, with
his mind fixed on the highest, scorns the high?
Who shall say, who does best service for humanity,
he who seeks the small attainable, or he who 'heaven's
success finds or earth's failure?'</p>

<p>Mazzini knew that he had failed in the near results.
He was a disappointed man. He had indeed the
pride that his utopia had come so near accomplishment.
But it had come by another way than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
which he had marked for it, it had fallen very short
of what he looked for. He had idealised his country
in his mighty love, till disillusion was inevitable. "I
saw," he wrote, "a great void in Europe, a void of any
community of belief or of faith, and therefore of initiative
and worship of duty and solemn moral principles,
of great ideas and potent action for the classes which
produce most and yet which are most wretched; and
I thought that Italy would rise and save Europe, and,
soon as it breathed its own new life, would say to itself
and others, 'I will fill that void.'" "Little it matters to
me," he wrote to "Daniel Stern," "that Italy, a territory
of so many square leagues, eats its corn and
cabbages cheaper; little I care for Rome, if a great
European initiative is not to issue from it. What I
do care for is that Italy shall be great and good, moral
and virtuous, that she comes to fulfil a mission in the
world." So he had dreamed, and woke to find it but
a dream. In bitter exaggeration he reproached his
countrymen for being "less than their fathers and
their destinies." In his favourite phrase, new Italy
had found its inspiration not in Dante but in Macchiavelli.
There was no high principle, no true religion, no
sense of freedom's dignity. His criticism was partly
a true one. The feeble statesmen, who succeeded
Cavour and Ricasoli, opportunists almost all, some of
them mere tricksters, may well have roused his anger
and contempt. The country had become the hunting-ground
of office-hunters and speculators, who, as
Giuditta Sidoli said, "have made Italy and now are
eating it." The antagonism of North and South, the
jealousy of Piedmont, the brigandage, the financial chaos
were symptoms of a dangerous discontent. Few cared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
for the great moral hopes, the "living apostolate" of
Italy. But Mazzini did not understand the value of
the sane, wholesome patriotism, that had made Italy
in its own way, or see how great the step had been,
that had brought the country political and social
freedom. In his absorption in the political question,
he paid at this time small attention to the social
changes that were going on; he never alludes to the
great cooperative movement, that was beginning in
Italy in these years.</p>

<p>But beyond all this, Unity was not complete, and
its completion was the one thing necessary. The
triumph of nationality, the cause of morality and
religion, alike in Italy and Europe, depended, he
believed, on the winning of Rome and Venice. "I
have to kill myself with work," he wrote, "for Venice,
for Rome, for the republic, in order to make the
instrument." The winning of Rome meant the downfall
of the Papacy, the triumph of liberty of conscience,
the dawn of a new religion. The winning of Venetia
meant the break-up of the Austrian Empire, and a
great reconstruction of Central and Eastern Europe,
in which Italy would prove her mission as the "guide
of oppressed nationalities." "Providence," he said, "has
written that the function of initiative is a necessary
condition of the life of Italy. We cannot live without
a European life; if we free ourselves, we must free
others. We must be great or perish." For Rome
he was willing to wait. Wiser than Garibaldi, he
saw that any attempt to win it by force meant war
at once with France and Austria, and he knew that
that meant ruin. His Roman policy was at bottom
that of the Piedmontese statesmen,&mdash;to secure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
withdrawal of the French by the force of public
opinion. He urged that there should be "a temperate
but weighty remonstrance" from parliament, backed
by half a million Italian signatures. He prompted
petitions in England to ask the government to use
its influence in the same direction,&mdash;a spur that Lord
John Russell hardly needed. But he rightly saw that
Venice must take precedence. Italy, he thought, was
strong enough to fight Austria alone, and he made
extravagant calculations as to their relative military
strength. Only there must be no French alliance, no
more paltering with the false prophet of nationality.
Cavour and his successors, except for brief backslidings,
were at one with him in the resolve never to call in
again the dangerous help of France. But he would
not believe this, and he hoped both to make the
French alliance impossible and force the government
into war with Austria, by fomenting a rising in Venetia
or encouraging volunteers under Garibaldi to attack it.
Italy's allies must be the nationalities of the East,
which had a common interest with her in breaking up
the Austrian Empire,&mdash;an idea which he shared with
the King and Cavour and others of the Italian statesmen.
If Venetia and the Balkan countries rose,
Hungary would follow, and "war with Austria would
dissolve the Empire in twenty days." With Austria,
Turkey would go too, for the two despotisms, he held,
must stand or fall together. The Polish rising of
1863 made him still more impatient. His love of
"poor, sacred Poland" was strong as in the days of
Young Europe. Forgetting that a resuscitated Poland
was bound to add its weight to the Catholic and anti-Italian
coalition, he reproached his countrymen for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
their indifference to the people, which had sent its sons
to fight for Italy; and he tried to charter a steamer to
take a cargo of arms to a Lithuanian port. He industriously
encouraged the pro-Polish movement in
England, and talked of organising a Hyde Park
meeting.</p>

<p>At home, he was still for some years yet willing to
suspend any open republican agitation. He indeed
attacked the government with increasing acerbity; he
fretted at its delays, he was irritated by the libels of
the royalist press. But though he held the monarchy
to be the source of all the trouble, he would not openly
declare against it. He kept up a secret republican propagandism
in view of future possibilities, but so long as
there was any hope that the monarchy would go to
Venice and Rome, he would not harass it by a barren
agitation. He knew in fact, that, so long as that hope
remained, the "ice-wall" of popular timidity made the
republic impossible, and he was angrily attacked by
the intransigents for his saner view. He was anxious
for the present even to postpone any agitation for
reform, though he pleaded insistently that, when the
work of unity was done, a Constituent Parliament
should meet to draw up a "national pact," which was
apparently to be an ill-defined constitution, temporarily
admitting a democratic monarchy, and defining the
social duties of the country and the respective functions
of state and local bodies. He had a bold domestic
programme, whose chief articles were a universal
volunteer system, the nationalisation of railways, mines,
church lands, and "some great industrial undertakings,"
state encouragement for productive cooperative societies,
and a reorganisation of local government on a basis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
some twelve large "regions" and big, amalgamated
communes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, save for an occasional visit to Switzerland,
he was living in England, where he returned after
leaving Naples at the end of 1860. Here in new
lodgings at 2 Onslow Terrace, Brompton, he returned
to the old life of the fifties. The days were
spent in the weary round of letter-writing, but it was
often a physical torture now, and failing eyesight
made it impossible to go on after dark. In the
evening he had two hours' reading, then went to the
Stansfelds' neighbouring house in Thurlow Square, to
return home at eleven and read his letters and the
Italian papers. His personal life was more and more
a struggle with failing health. Earlier attacks he had
conquered by force of will. "Make an effort of will
and be well; I have often successfully done so," he
wrote once to a friend; and again, "I hear that you
are rather unwell. Don't. It is absurd to be ill,
while nations are struggling for liberty." He had
always scorned medicine and doctors, and had an
especial detestation for "that infernal irony of homæopathy,
for which Hahnemann must atone somehow,
somewhere." But now he had often to succumb to an
internal trouble, which brought acute pain and sometimes
prostrated him. He no doubt smoked too much,
and a few years after this Lloyd Garrison tried in vain to
break him off the habit. Rheumatism made him "stiff like
an English statesman." He could not eat his landlady's
ill-cooked dinners, and hid the untouched food rather than
hurt her feelings. Now and again he would feel he had
"more than ever the ardour of a young man with all
the obstinacy of an old one"; more often he knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
work was killing him, and he had a recurring presentiment
that he would not live through each new year.
He had financial troubles again to worry him. His
small annuity was not enough to meet his heavy
doctor's bills, and a royalty, which he had been receiving
for the collected edition of his writings, failed
through the unwillingness or inability to pay of his
Milanese publisher. A subscription was raised for him
in Italy, but it was passed on to his Venetian fund, and
probably most of the £500, that were collected for him
in England in 1866, went to public purposes. Serene
and cheerful as ever on the outside, he had moods of
great depression. "I am sick of men and things," he
wrote, "and long for a desperate peace." "Morally," he
writes to "Daniel Stern," with whom he began a steady
correspondence at this time, "I am always the same,
given up to work without enthusiasm, from a sense of
duty; expecting nothing, hoping for nothing in the
scrap of individual life left me; loving and recognising
those I love,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> not for the joy but for the sorrow they
can give me; believing, as in early youth, in the future
I have dreamed of for Italy and the world; sick at the
present, but resigned and calm, if people don't talk too
much of materialist pantheism or tactics or happiness
or French music." When Lincoln was assassinated,
he contrasted sadly with himself the man who died in
the knowledge that his cause had triumphed.</p>

<p>His literary work at this time was unimportant,
for politics and sickness used up his strength; but
his longings went, as ever, to a life of study. "I should
like," he wrote, "to drag myself from library to library,
from one monastic archives to another, to unearth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
some lines of a great forgotten thinker, Joachim for
instance." Mystical writers, like Joachim and Eckhart,
attracted him more strongly than ever; and he seems
to have joined an esoteric society in Italy, which had
Dante for its spiritual chief. Modern spiritualism,
however, only irritated him; "when men have ceased
to believe in God," he said, "God pays them out by
making them believe in Cagliostro or table-turning."</p>

<p>His admiration of English life was stronger than
ever. He held up for Italian imitation its freedom of
life and thought, notwithstanding his suspicions that
his letters still ran the risk of being tampered with in
the English Post-Office. He had words of praise even
for the monarchy and aristocracy, but predicted that
the growing power of financial magnates would prove
the death of both. It was about this time that he
became again a prominent figure in English politics.
A Calabrian, named Greco, attempted to assassinate
Louis Napoleon. Mazzini had had no part in or
knowledge of the plot; but he had known Greco in
the past, and letters from him were found on the
assassin. The French police caught at the opportunity
to bring odium on him and inculpate Stansfeld,
whose name and address were found in one of his
letters. Without any particle of evidence to connect
the letters with the plot, the French court condemned
Mazzini; and the Tories and Irish in the House of
Commons gleefully used the handle given them to
discredit his English friend. Stansfeld, who was a
member of the government, resigned office rather
than embarrass his colleagues, but the insincerity of
the attack was as clear as its audacious shamelessness.
The incident had its sequel of comedy, when Disraeli,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
who had been foremost in denouncing the imagined
sympathy with assassination, was confronted with a
<i>Revolutionary Epick</i> of his own youthful days, in
which he had blessed "the regicidal steel."</p>

<p>Mazzini keenly watched the American Civil War.
He had for many years felt intensely about slavery,
and he now gave his sympathy and subscription to
the London Emancipation Society, which was enlisting
English sympathy for the North. "I believe," he
wrote to his friend, Mr W. Malleson, who was its
Secretary, "that in these times of ours there are three
things, against which a man ought to protest before
dying, if he wants to die in peace with his own conscience:
slavery&mdash;capital punishment&mdash;and the actual
either narrow or hypocritical condition of the religious
question." "Abolition," he wrote to Mr Moncure
Conway, "is the religious consecration of your battles."
But he was not equally enthusiastic for the Union.
In curious inconsistency with his usual preference for
big nations, he thought that America was "wide enough
for two or three eventual sisterly confederations."
When the war was over, he implored the Americans
not to impair their victory by refusing the vote to
the negroes, though they should see that education
went hand in hand with it. Again, as in 1854, he
was eager that America should come into world
politics, and help to build up the future Europe of
nationality and the republic. "You," he said, "have
become a leading nation. You may act as such. In
the great battle which is fought throughout the world
between right and wrong, justice and arbitrary rule,
equality and privilege, duty and egotism, republic and
monarchy, truth and lies, God and idols, your part is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
marked; you must accept it." He hoped that they
would upset Napoleon's Mexican scheme, which meant
"Imperialism at their own door"; at the time of the
suggested Anglo-French intervention, when American
feeling was bitter against England, he wrote, "war with
England would be a crime and a fault; war for Mexico
a holy thing." Shortly before Lincoln's assassination,
he and Ledru Rollin and Karl Blind wrote to the
President, urging the danger to the Union that
threatened from Mexico, and suggesting a cooperation
with the democrats of Europe, that would weaken or
upset Napoleon. Apparently the plan was that the
Americans should invade Mexico, while their unofficial
allies stirred a republican movement in France
or organised an attack on Rome. Lincoln seems
to have listened to the suggestion not unfavourably.
When the Northern army disbanded after the war,
Mazzini would have liked to see the men go as
volunteers to aid the Mexicans, and the government
"whisper" that it would follow. "It would have
done more than anything towards the fraternisation
of North and South, and the negroes would have
won then, undisputed, the right to the suffrage."</p>

<p>A few years later, he was much concerned in the
fate of the Fenian prisoners. "I am feeling," he
writes, "between the unhappy and the furious about
the Fenians condemned. To-day, I think, is the
Queen's birthday. Does she read a newspaper?
Cannot she find a womanly feeling in her heart and
ask the Cabinet to commute the punishment? In
point of fact, the killing of these men will prove an
absolute fault [mistake]. Burke will be the Robert
Emmet of 1867. A feeling of revenge will rekindle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the energy of the discouraged Fenians. The dream
will become, through martyrdom, a sort of religion.
But that is not my ground. It is the legal murder
reenacted against a <i>thought</i>, a thought which ought to
be refuted, destroyed by thought only. Burke and
others are genuine believers in Irish nationality. I
think they are philosophically and politically wrong;
but are we to refute a philosophical error with
hanging?" After their reprieve he wrote, "You have
been spared the infamy of Burke's execution. I am
glad of it; I have a weakness for England, and did
not like the shame for her."</p>

<p class="p2">Mazzini's active political work in these years was
given almost wholly to the winning of Venetia.
Before he left Naples in 1860, he and Garibaldi had
agreed to agitate for an attack on either Venetia or
Rome in the following year. But the jealousy, that
was always latent between the two, prevented any
cordial cooperation. The fault was very little on
Mazzini's side. He must have felt it, that Garibaldi,
whose work for the country was so small beside his
own, had eclipsed himself in the nation's imagination;
but he was ever ready to let him take the honour
and keep himself in the background. Once get
Garibaldi with the volunteers, he said, "and he may
send me to the devil the day after." But Garibaldi
had always some grievance to nurse, and he had not
forgotten the friction at Rome in 1849. Mazzini's
theories irritated him, and he dubbed him "the great
doctrinaire." The most easily led of men, "weak
beyond expression," as Mazzini truly said of him, he
hated it to be thought that he was under anybody's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
influence; and Mazzini complained with cause that "if
Garibaldi has to choose between two proposals, he is
sure to accept the one that isn't mine." The mischief-makers,
who always clustered round the hermit of
Caprera, did their best to feed his prejudices. And
though the two men were both burning to free Venice
and Rome, they had radical differences as to the
means. Garibaldi believed in the King; Mazzini's
faith in him was very limited. Garibaldi wanted to
have an understanding with the government; Mazzini
generally wished to act independently. He saw that
the patriots must concentrate on the freeing of Venice;
Garibaldi was ever running back to his cherished
design of marching to Rome, or, if he temporarily
abandoned it, he leaned to some knight-errant enterprise
in Eastern Europe, where he could attack Austria
from the rear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Minghetti and the less statesmanlike
section of the Moderates,&mdash;a tepid, craven, weak-principled
crew,&mdash;wanted to stamp out the democratic
agitation; and it was left comparatively unmolested,
thanks only to the bigger outlook of Ricasoli, who had
become premier after Cavour's death. Had Ricasoli
remained in office, he would have amnestied Mazzini
from the sentence of 1857; and the greatest of living
Italians would have been no longer a felon in his own
country. But Ricasoli was driven from office by a
cabal; and Rattazzi, who succeeded him, was too
much under bond to Louis Napoleon to pardon the
Emperor's enemy. Rattazzi began a double game
with Garibaldi, which ended, as Mazzini had predicted,
in "a solemn mystification" and the catastrophe of
Aspromonte. Mazzini was opposed to the whole foolhardy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
business, and among his English friends condemned
it in strong language; but apparently he
helped to collect funds for Garibaldi, and when once
Garibaldi took up the cry of "Rome or Death," he
thought it his duty to help. The day after the
volunteers crossed from Sicily on the tragi-comic
march for Rome, he left London to join them. He
had got as far as Lugano, when he heard that Italian
soldiers had fired on them, and that Garibaldi lay
stricken by an Italian bullet. His anguish at the pity
of it all brought on delirium. The ghosts of martyr-patriots
reproached him, as they had done in 1836;
he cried that Garibaldi was dead, and his friends could
not quiet his ravings. He recovered quickly, but
broke into passionate denunciation of the government,
scourging the monarchy as impotent and unwilling to
make Italy, and threatening to raise the republican flag
again.</p>

<p>The threat was forgotten, as he regained his calmness,
and he returned to his old plan of a volunteer
movement on Venetia, which the government would
be compelled to follow. He was "silently raging at
poor, brave Poland being left alone in the field," and
hoped that an attack on Austria would save her. It
was at this juncture,&mdash;in the spring of 1863,&mdash;that he
received strange overtures for alliance from the King.
The two men had always had a certain fascination
for each other. Victor Emmanuel shared Mazzini's
impatience to win Venetia, his hatred of Austria; he
had something of the great agitator's wish to see
the nationalities of Eastern Europe free. Both were
irritated by the feeble Minghetti ministry, which had
come into office after Aspromonte, half-hearted in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
nationalist aspirations, dreading the democratic forces,
which Cavour would have taken in hand and guided.
The fellow-conspirators bargained hard, but, after
months of tedious negotiation, they seem to have
agreed that Mazzini should foment a rising in Venetia
and waive meanwhile any republican movement, that
the King should make his government supply arms to
the insurgents and eventually declare war, while both
would encourage a rising in Hungary or Galicia. It
was impossible, however, to give effect to the alliance.
The fact of the negotiations leaked out more or less.
The Greco plot, though probably few believed that
Mazzini was an accomplice, made it difficult for the
King to treat with him. The ministers, morbidly
afraid of any contact with the revolutionaries, and
possibly aware that Mazzini had made their dismissal
a condition of his cooperation, remonstrated; and
indeed it shows the King's and Mazzini's small respect
for parliamentary government that the personal treaty
was attempted at all. The King was irritated at
Mazzini's exigencies, and began to transfer his attentions
to Garibaldi. Garibaldi at this moment (April
1864) was paying a long promised visit to England,
where he had a mythical prestige almost as great as
in his own country. As usual he was buffeted by the
various influences that sought to capture him. The
English Radicals wanted to use him for a series of
popular demonstrations; Palmerston laid his schemes
to keep him quiet in the hands of hosts, like the Duke
of Sutherland and Charles Seely, the member for
Lincoln, who would be responsible for his discreet
behaviour. Victor Emmanuel, while still negotiating
fitfully with Mazzini, sent his agents to persuade him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to head a rising in Galicia; Mazzini wanted him for
the Venetian movement. The worthy, puzzled man
tried to please everybody, provided that he appeared
to be managed by nobody. Mazzini wrote to him to
begin his tour in the provinces at once, before he went
to London; and met him, soon after he arrived, at
Mr Seely's house in the Isle of Wight. There was a
cordial reconciliation, and Mazzini thought he had won
Garibaldi to his own scheme. At a breakfast given
by Alexander Herzen, the one rich man among the
exiles, at his house at Teddington, Garibaldi spoke
of Mazzini as the counsellor of his youth and constant
friend. The incident alarmed the English government,
and their contemptible and dishonorable man&oelig;uvres
secured Garibaldi's departure. Mazzini still supposed
that Garibaldi was faithful to his scheme, and went to
Lugano to forward the preparations for the Venetian
insurrection.</p>

<p>Garibaldi, however, though he had given Mazzini no
hint of his change of mind, had accepted the King's
plan. The Duke of Sutherland's yacht took him to
Ischia, where he was preparing to sail to the East,
when the secret was given to the world; and the
King, frightened by the publicity, hastily broke from
the plot. Mazzini, though he tried to persuade Garibaldi
to visit England again and make his abandoned provincial
tour ("Newcastle is the best place"), was justly
incensed at him and the King for their want of candour.
He suspected, with good reason, that the ministry had
fallen in with the Galician scheme, for the sake of getting
Garibaldi out of the country and perhaps sending him
to his death. He was "sick at heart of the equivocal
position," and determined to "go on in a clearer path."
Events helped to bring him back to frank hostility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
towards the government. The September Convention,
most dishonouring and impolitic of treaties, was concluded,
and it seemed to mark, as in the letter it did,
a renunciation of the claims to Rome. He passionately
denounced the surrender, the "policy of subterfuge and
crooked ways," which threatened to founder Italy. "I
prefer half a century of slavery to a national lie," he
wrote. He was hoaxed into believing that the government
had offered France a large slice of Piedmont
to buy her acquiescence in any winning of Venice or
Rome. He had a bitter quarrel with Crispi, who was
fast sliding down the decline of respectability. Crispi
had attacked him in the Chamber, as dividing the
country by his republicanism. Mazzini wasted words
in retorting on the opportunist, who yesterday had
been most intransigent of republicans, and was now
parading his new-found faith in the monarchy. He
was inclined to break the slender threads, that connected
him with the parliamentary Left, "who had
laid aside their old democratic ardour to assume the
icy demeanour of English members of parliament."
But he still hesitated at any complete rupture with the
monarchy, so long as any hope remained that the
government would attack Austria.</p>

<p>It was doing better than he knew. The outcry at
the September Convention had wrecked Minghetti's
ministry, and under the brave and honest La Marmora
there was some chance of going forward. The negotiations
for the Prussian alliance were pushed on, and
early in April 1866 the treaty was signed. Mazzini
had preached co-operation with Germany in 1851 and
1861, but now he denounced the alliance with "men
who represented despotism," an alliance which, he
imagined, implied the abandonment of the claims to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the Tyrol. He had information, which again was
almost certainly inaccurate, as to the arrangement of
Biarritz, and "knew from positive information" that
Italy had promised to cede Sardinia and part of
Piedmont to France, as the price of Napoleon's help.
Much, however, as he disliked the diplomacy, still it
was a war for Venice, and he urged his followers to
join the volunteers. If the war ended in victory, they
could then march on to Rome. He had his plan of
operations for the war,&mdash;to mask the Quadrilateral,
and push on with the main body of the army to
Vienna, while the volunteers landed in Istria and tried
to rouse the Slavs. Whether the plan was original or
not, it was almost identical with one, which had been
favoured by Ricasoli, now again premier, by Cialdini,
one of the two Italian commanders, and probably by
Bismarck, and which was rejected, or at least mutilated,
only by La Marmora's opposition.</p>

<p>All the world had expected to see the Italians easily
victorious. But again, as in 1848, their chance was
spoilt by incompetent generalship. The army was
defeated at Custozza, the fleet at Lissa; Garibaldi and
the volunteers had little of the spirit of 1860, and were
paralysed in the Tyrol. Equally unexpectedly, the
Prussians on their side had triumphed swiftly and conclusively;
and Napoleon, afraid that the unforeseen
events would nip his schemes, stepped in with a
message that Austria had offered to cede Venetia to
himself and that he would hand it over to Italy, if
peace were made. It was a bitter and humiliating
end,&mdash;to lay down arms under the shadow of defeat,
to abandon the Tyrol and Istria, to have Venetia not
by right of conquest but by the condescension of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
detested patron. Mazzini did not know how unwillingly
the government had bowed to a fate, which the
military position made inevitable. To him it seemed
mere pusillanimity, pregnant with "dishonour and ruin."
"It is my lot," he sadly wrote, "to consume my last
days in the grief, supreme to one who really loves,
of seeing the thing, one loves most, inferior to its
mission."</p>

</p>

<p>In his ignorance of the facts, he charged it all to
the monarchy. The nation had been sacrificed to the
interests of a dynasty. Defeat and dishonour came of
the equivocations, that sprang from the "primal falsehood"
of royalty. The bad government and coercion
(which, in fact, was mild enough), the huge army and
civil service and police, the consequent financial chaos&mdash;all
were its fruit. He disclaimed that it was the
republic for its own sake that he wanted now, for its
advent was only the question of a few years more or
less, and its triumph might be left to time. But dishonour
was the "gangrene of a nation," and only the
republic could cure that. Only the republic could win
Rome, gather Istria and the Tyrol to the fold, and
stretch a hand to the struggling nationalities of the
East. But, if the republic came, it must be as a great
"moralising education, to change men from serfs to
citizens, and make them conscious of their mission, their
strength and dignity." The republic must not mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
revenge, or spoliation, or repudiation of debt, or violent
anti-clericalism; and he was already beginning his
crusade against Bakounine and the rough socialism,
which was making some headway in the country.</p>

<p>He had promised that if he resumed his republican
agitation, he would announce it frankly beforehand,
and he did so now. Henceforth he gave it all his
failing strength. Hopeless as their cause probably
was at the best, the republicans had a strength now,
which they had not had for fifteen years. The shame
of Custozza and Lissa lay heavy on the nation, and
the disillusioning had shaken faith in men and institutions.
The sense of national dishonour maddened;
civil war was often on men's lips; the King's prestige
was foundering under the load of private vice and
military failure. There was a mass of sullen, unformulated
discontent, ready to find its way into socialist
or republican channels. And though men were slow
to follow Mazzini into his conspiracies, his long years
of self-sacrificing labour, the mystery that wrapped
the exile and conspirator, had given him a vast,
almost mythical fascination for his countrymen. Forty
thousand persons had signed the petition for his
amnesty. Messina elected him time after time for its
deputy, to have the election quashed as often by the
Moderates in the Chamber. There was an angry
feeling everywhere at the senseless intolerance, and
the deputies of the Left did their best to bring the
majority to reason. "While you are still in time,"
said a recent premier of Italy, "prevent Mazzini from
having to close his eyes in a foreign land."</p>

<p>When at last he was amnestied at the beginning of the
war, he refused to accept it as an act of grace or take
his seat as deputy, and returned to Lugano. Much of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
his time henceforth was spent there with his friends,
Giuseppe Nathan and his wife Sarah, "the best Italian
friend I have, one of the best women I know," who nursed
him in the attacks of illness, which came with ever greater
frequency. Here he would watch "the beautiful calm-lulling
lake, the beautiful, solemn, hopeful-death-teaching
sunsets." When he was well, he kept to the
habits of his English life, writing all day, delighting
his friends in the evening with his brilliant talk. His
conspiracies often took him to Genoa, where he lived
in hiding in the house of a working family, from whose
windows in the Salita di Oregina he had a superb
view of the city and the Riviera. He nearly betrayed
himself once by shouting from his window at a boy
who was torturing a grasshopper. He kept in close
touch with his English friends and English life. At
Lugano he regularly read "the good, dry Spectator
and the would-be wicked, never concluding Saturday
Review." He made a custom of always returning to
England to spend New Year's Day with the Stansfelds
or others of their family, crossing the Alps in mid-winter
at the peril of his health. He had painfully
aged. His face had sunk and wore a deathly pallor; the
thick, black hair was thin and grey. William Lloyd
Garrison, seeing him after an interval of twenty-one
years, sadly noted the change, though "the same dark,
lustrous eyes" remained, "the same classical features,
the same grand intellect, the same lofty and indomitable
spirit, the same combination of true modesty and
heroic assertion, of exceeding benignity and inspirational
power." Work told heavily upon him now.
Writing made him giddy, and his characters begin to
lose their firmness. He was "living as if in a whirlwind,
something like Paolo without Francesca, tired,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
worn out, longing for rest." But he would not slacken.
"I am bound to those, whom I have organised for a
purpose. I must, before I die, proclaim the republic
in Italy."</p>

<p>While he was organising his "Republican Alliance,"
losing himself in the huge work of detail which
all came to so little, the impatience in Italy was
breaking down the precautions of the government.
Ricasoli had been driven from office by his own maladroitness
and Garibaldi's wild, aimless opposition.
Rattazzi, the intriguer of 1862, came back to power,
and began the double play, that was only too likely
to lead to another Aspromonte. There is no need
here to analyse the obscure and sordid story of his
balancings between the Italian democrats and France.
Garibaldi was impatient to win Rome, and cared comparatively
little now whether it were in the name of
monarchy or republic. His plan was to lead a raid,
with or without the connivance of the government,
into the small territory that still belonged to the Pope,
meet and defeat the Papal mercenaries, and enter
Rome. With Mazzini the republic was now a more
vital thing than Unity. Only from a republican
Rome could Italy perform her civilising mission to
the world. "If Rome is to be annexed like the rest,"
he wrote, "I would rather it belonged to the Pope
another three years." He disliked Garibaldi's scheme;
he was not sanguine of its success; if it did succeed,
it meant that the monarchy would go to Rome and
the Pope stay there. He wished to see the Romans
rise themselves and pronounce for a republic, confident
that, if they did so, Italy would echo the republican
cry, and the Pope would have to go. Sometimes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
however, despairing of his own party, he was willing
to compromise; and when at last Garibaldi started
on his raid, and the government backed him, risking
hostilities with France rather than have civil war, he
forgot everything else in the hope of winning Rome,
and urged his followers to join the raiders. Probably,
if he had not been prostrated by illness, he would have
gone himself. When Garibaldi's incapacity was only
too apparent, and the French troops landed again for
the defence of Rome, he saw that the volunteers were
advancing into a trap, and implored Garibaldi to retire
to Naples, raise the flag of revolution, and collect
forces for another and more hopeful attack. Garibaldi,
marching obstinately to defeat, was in no temper to
listen to anybody, to Mazzini least of all. The
mischief-makers had persuaded him that Mazzini was
tampering with his men. There was no particle of
truth in it, but the conviction entered Garibaldi's mind
and never left it, while Mazzini lived.</p>

<p>The volunteers went to their doom at Mentana.
Rattazzi, who at the last rose above himself and would
have marched to Rome but for the King's veto, had
resigned some weeks before. Menabrea, who succeeded
him, had been compelled by public opinion to occupy
a part of the Pope's territory; but when the French
landed, he withdrew the troops, rather than face war
with France. The country writhed in its rage at the
French insult, and naturally turned its resentment
against the crown. Juries acquitted republican papers;
the press lampooned the King. Some of the deputies
gave a secret backing to the republican movement;
the Friendly Societies, which had always kept more
or less in touch with Mazzini, threw themselves into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
it. Mazzini had a following among the Freemasons,
though not one himself, and among the ex-volunteers.
Most ominous feature of it all, republicanism gained
a large footing in the rank-and-file of the army.
Mazzini pushed on impatiently for Rome and the
republic. He knew that the Romans themselves were
powerless to rise, now that the French were there, and
that a volunteer movement had no better chance.
The only plan, that could successfully defy the French
and capture Rome, was to seize the government,&mdash;its
army and navy and arsenals,&mdash;and make a national
crusade with all the resources of the country. The
royalists, he thought, would never break with France
or attack the Papacy; and indeed the criticism was
true of the conservative ministry, which now held
office. He was equally hopeless of the middle classes,
but he was confident that the people would respond.
Especially he trusted to the younger generation and
the women of Italy; they alone, he thought, were free
from the timid opportunism, which had eaten deep into
the rest.</p>

<p>After Mentana he left London again for Lugano to
be nearer his work, and was constantly passing backwards
and forwards between there and Genoa, finding
time among it all to write his great religious apology,
the sum of all his teaching, <i>From the Council to
God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> His following at Genoa was considerable now.
When he came there secretly, little patrols of working
men with concealed arms would watch along the
streets between the station and his lodgings to guard
his person from seizure by the police. The Committee
sat waiting for him, each man armed with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
revolver. One of them has described the meeting.
"A low knock was heard at the door, and there he
was in body and soul, the great magician, who struck
the fancy of the people like a mythical hero. Our
hearts leaped, and we went reverently to meet that
great soul. He advanced with a child's frank courtesy
and a divine smile, shaking hands like an Englishman,
and addressing each of us by name, as if our names
were written on our foreheads. He was not disguised;
he wore cloth shoes, and a capote, and with his middle,
upright stature, he looked like a philosopher, straight
from his study, who never dreamed of troubling any
police in the world." In the spring of 1869 he was
eager for action, despite the failure of a plot, discouraged
by himself, among the garrison at Milan. The remonstrances
of the government procured his banishment
from Switzerland, but he was back again in August,
going "more sadly than usual, feeling physically and
intellectually weaker and unequal to the task." He
was suffering continuously, and confessed to his
friends that he shrank from the effort. He was
obviously going on from sheer inability to stop more
than from any hope of success. "My new plan,"
he wrote gloomily, "may prove a dream like many
others."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1870 he came again to Genoa to
arrange the details. The plot broke down like the
rest, and at the moment everything was overshadowed
by the coming Franco-German war. In common
with the great majority of his countrymen, outside
the court and government, his sympathies were with
Germany. A German victory would avenge Mentana
and compel the French to withdraw from Rome. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
spite of his denunciation of the Prussian alliance in
1866, he had been for three years past carrying on a
desultory intrigue with Bismarck. About the time of
Mentana he had sent a note to Bismarck through their
go-between. "I do not in the least," it said, "share
Count Bismarck's political views; his method of
unification does not command my sympathy; but I
admire his tenacity and energy and independence
towards the foreigner. I believe in German unity and
desire it as much as that of my own country. I abhor
the Empire and the supremacy it arrogates over
Europe." He saw in the intrigue a chance of pushing
his own schemes, and at the same time of preventing a
Franco-Italian alliance against Germany. He asked
Bismarck to send him arms and money, and promised,
if he had them, to guarantee him against the hostile
combination. Bismarck parleyed with him for a time,
as he had parleyed with Garibaldi; and when war
was imminent, and he knew that Victor Emmanuel
and many of the Italian conservatives were trying
again to commit the country to a French alliance, he
promised that the arms and money should be sent.
Mazzini hastened to accept, promising to attack Rome
with the revolutionary forces, and undertaking to
respect the wish of the country, should a future
Constituent Assembly declare for the monarchy. But
Bismarck had learnt now that the danger of the
hostile alliance had passed, and the promised help
never came. The intrigue marks the last stage in
Mazzini's political decline. That he had asked a
foreign government to assist in what meant civil war,
shows how the long years of conspiracy had distorted
his moral vision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>He had intended to use Bismarck's money for a
new plot, this time in Sicily. It was a fool's errand,
and his friends tried in vain to dissuade him. But
the monomania was on him, and he started for the
island in disguise. As so often before, he had a
traitor in his secrets, a man who with strange inconsistency
had nursed him tenderly through an illness,
while he was making a living by betraying his plans
to the French police.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> When Mazzini arrived by the
Naples steamer at Palermo, he was arrested. He was
taken to Gaeta and treated with all possible consideration.
The very gaoler took three minutes to turn the
noisy keys silently, that he might soften the sense of
imprisonment. Here through the loopholes of the
massive fortress, where the Bourbons had made their
last stand nine years before, he would watch the sea
and sky, as he had done at Savona thirty-nine years
ago. "The nights," he writes, "are very beautiful; the
stars shine with a lustre one only sees in Italy. I
love them like sisters, and link them to the future in a
thousand ways. If I could choose, I should like to
live in absolute solitude, working at my historical book
or at some other, just from a feeling of duty, and only
wishing to see&mdash;for a moment, now and then,&mdash;some
one I did not know, some poor woman that I
could help, some working men I could advise, the
doves of Zürich, and nothing else." He smoked indifferent
cigars; he read bad translations of Shakespeare
and Byron from the prison library, and, for want of
better, Tasso's <i>Gerusalemme</i>. He was planning again
a book on Byron, and asks for Taine's critique of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in his <i>Littérature anglaise</i>. "Taine is a materialist
writer, and certainly won't have an idea that squares
with mine; but I am intellectually half-asleep and I
reckon on the stimulus of contradiction and the irritation
which I shall get out of his book. He has enough
perverted intellectual power to wake me up."</p>

<p>He was released a few weeks later, after the capture
of Rome, but he still refused to accept the amnesty,
that he might keep his hands free, "without even the
shadow of ungratefulness to anybody&mdash;even to a king."
His one anxiety for the moment was to escape the
popular demonstrations of sympathy, and get to a
quiet life among his friends. He passed a restless
night at Rome; it was twenty-one years since
Margaret Fuller and Giulia Modena had persuaded
the ex-Triumvir to save himself and fly. He went to
Leghorn to his friends the Rossellis; thence to Genoa,
to see his mother's tomb, and fled to escape the
ovations, with his old sickness on him. "The only
thing really touching to me," he wrote to England,
"was in the churchyard&mdash;it was late&mdash;and the place
was quite empty, but a keeper had, it seems, recognised
me, and coming out of the gate, some poor people, a
priest among them, were drawn up in a line, bowing
and almost touching the earth. Not a smile, no
attempt at absurd applause, they felt my sadness, and
contrived to show they were sharing it."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The popular
welcome had been dust and ashes to him; "even Swinburne's
praise," he wrote from Gaeta, "makes me sad.
Who am I, whom he praises?" His ideal was shattered.
Rome had "the profanation of a corrupt and dishonoured
monarchy," and he knew that the monarchy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
winning of the capital meant that the republic would
not come in his day. France, not Italy, had proclaimed
the republic, and in a spirit that he hated. His own
party had failed him. "Italy, my Italy," he said, "the
Italy that I have preached, the Italy of our dreams?
Italy, the great, the beautiful, the moral Italy of my
heart? This medley of opportunists and cowards
and little Macchiavellis, that let themselves be dragged
behind the suggestion of the foreigner,&mdash;I thought to
call up the soul of Italy, and I only see its corpse."
"Yes, dear," he writes to Mrs Stansfeld, "I love more
deeply than I thought my poor dreamt-of Italy, my
old vision of Savona. I want to see, before dying,
another Italy, the ideal of my soul and life, start up
from her three hundred years' grave: this is only the
phantom, the mockery of Italy. And the thought
haunts me, like the incomplete man in Frankenstein,
seeking for a soul from its maker."</p>

<p>But henceforth he resigns conspiracy. Sometimes
he still hoped for insurrection, still believed that "a
month of action transforms a people more than ten
years of being preached to"; but he knew that
the republic was afar off, that all he could do now
was quietly to educate his countrymen, especially the
working classes. "Tell the working-men of Genoa,"
so he sent his message, "that this is not a time for
demonstrations but self-education. Germany is the only
country that deserves a republic." He helped to organise
the Friendly Societies; he advocated evening classes for
workmen, circulating popular libraries, the collection of a
fund to assist societies for co-operative production; he
founded a paper, <i>Roma del Popolo</i>, to spread his ideas.
He still hoped to write his popular history on Italy and
a book on national education,&mdash;hopes, alas, never fulfilled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
He published <i>From the Council to God</i>, and was
delighted at the success it met with in its English translation
in the Fortnightly. He was keenly interested in
the English movements for women's suffrage and against
state regulation of vice. But his chief work in these last
years was to fight the immature socialism of the time.
He was bitterly chagrined by the "invasion of barbarians,"
which was threatening to conquer the Italian
working-classes to socialism or anarchism. The International
had passed out of its first stage as an organiser
of trade-unionism, and was now the battle-ground
between the anarchists under Bakounine and the
collectivists, who followed Karl Marx. In its earlier
days Mazzini had had some relations with it and
Bakounine; he had advised his followers to join it,
and had a high opinion of its English leaders, Odger
and Cremer, "for their power of intellect and heart
and their sincere devotion to the cause." He had
tried to make it a political, revolutionary society;
and when he found himself defeated by Marx' opposition,
he retired. Since then, the International
had turned to far other roads of revolution. Mazzini
hardly distinguished between the two sections that
were fighting for mastery in it, and banned indiscriminately
the atheism and anarchism of the one
and the socialism of the other. And in fact both
were equally alien from his spiritual basis of life,
his fervid faith in nationality, his more modest
economic programme.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But he was careful to show
that his criticism came from no lack of social aspiration.
"Those, whom you call barbarians," he retorted
on the Italian conservatives, who had used the word in
a far other sense, "represent an idea,&mdash;the inevitable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
destined rise of the men of Labour." The International,
he argued, was the necessary fruit of middle-class
indifference to social reform; and the Assembly
at Versailles was more guilty than the Commune.
He had, in fact, small liking for the Third Republic.
A republic, which had only come for lack of an
alternative, which had Thiers for its chief, and made
no sign of restoring Nice, was a republic only in
form. When he read Renan's <i>Réforme intellectuelle
et morale</i>, it confirmed him in his distrust of France;
and, almost on his death-bed, he reviewed the book
in words of acute disappointment at its spirit.</p>

<p>The long life of fighting was fast closing in weariness
and sense of failure. "This life of a machine,
that writes and writes and writes for thirty-five years,
begins to weigh upon me strangely." He had bitter
personal chagrins; his one surviving sister refused to
see him, from religious differences; Garibaldi would
not be reconciled. All through the end of 1871 he
was kept alive only by the devoted attention of
Bertani, who looked after his patient as well as he
had organised the Expedition of the Thousand. He
still refused to accept the amnesty, and travelled
under an assumed name to Pisa and Genoa and
Florence, where he laid a wreath on Ugo Foscolo's
tomb, for the bones of his hero had been lately
brought from Chiswick to rest in Santa Croce.
Giuditta Sidoli, "good, holy, constant Giuditta," died.
"Did she die a Christian?" he enquires; "any
faith, even though imperfect and spoilt by false
doctrine, comforts the pillow of the dying better than
the dry, thin, gloomy travesty of Science, which is
called now-a-days Free Thought or Rationalism."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
He knew his own end was not far, and he was willing
it should come. "Strange," he said, "that I see all those
I loved go one by one, while I remain, I know not why."
His one care was that the work should still go on.
"What matter," he wrote, "how many years or months
I still live down here? Shall I love you less because I
go elsewhere to work? Will you love me less, when
you can only love me by working? I often think, that
when at last I leave you, you will all work with more
faith and ardour, to prevent my having lived in vain."
In his last words to the working men of Italy he says,
"love and work for this great, unhappy country of ours,
called to high destinies, but stayed upon the road by
those who cannot, will not know the road. This is the
best way that you can have of loving me." One of
his last acts was to repay an old loan of half a lifetime's
standing. In the mild spring of 1872 he was
living at a house that belonged to Pellegrino Rosselli,
son-in-law of his old friends, the Nathans of Lugano,
in the Via Maddalena at Pisa. People would watch
the white-haired stranger, who went by the name of
Brown, taking his daily walk, with the affectionate eyes
and a kind word for every child. Early in March he
was taken very ill and sank rapidly. On the 10th he
died. His last conscious words were&mdash;"Believe in
God? Yes, I do believe in God." He was buried,
where he had always wished to lie, beside his mother,
in the cemetery of Staglieno outside Genoa. There,
in the words of Carducci's epitaph, rests</p>

</p>

<p>Mazzini's life was one piece of almost perfect consistency
and continuity. Save in minor points of
policy, it had no turnings, no conversions, no recantations.
Alike in theory and practice, it goes on its
straight, undeviating course from his youthful literary
essays to the full-bodied doctrine of <i>The Duties of
Man</i> and <i>From the Council to God</i>, from the first days
of Young Italy to those of the Republican Alliance.
And its magnificent unity comes of this, that all was
dominated by a scheme of thought, that controlled and
correlated each sphere of human action. Supremely he
achieved the harmony of life, which he never wearied
of extolling. He was politician, philosopher, religious
reformer, literary critic; and every side of life completes
the others in a perfect synthesis. At the centre of
it all, controlling, illuminating, energizing, stands his
religious faith. To him religion was "the eternal,
essential, indwelling element of life," "the breath of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
humanity, its soul and life and consciousness and outward
symbol," hallowing men's thoughts and actions,
ennobling, consoling, fortifying, the inspiring principle
of brotherhood and social service. Deep in the conscience
of each man, inseparable from life, lies the
religious sense,&mdash;the sense of the Infinite and Imperishable,
the aspiration to the Unknown and Invisible, the
innate desire to apprehend God in his intellect and
love. "If ever you have," he once said, "a strange
moment of religious feeling, of supreme resignation,
of quiet love of humanity, of a calm insight of duty,
kneel down thankful, and treasure within yourself the
feeling suddenly arisen. It is the feeling of life."
And with the sense of the Divine, there comes to man
the yearning to reach after the divine perfection and
the importunate searching for the way. In every age,
men have asked "to know, or at least to surmise, something
of the starting-point and goal of mundane
existence"; and religion comes to teach "the general
principles that rule humanity, to sanction the link that
makes men brothers in the consciousness of that one
origin, one mission, one common aim." Man makes
that mission and that aim his guiding star in all his
strivings for the good; and in every branch of his
activity he steers his course by his knowledge of God.
"From the general formula, that men call religion,
issues a rule of education, a basis of human brotherhood,
a policy, a social economy, an art." It is
impossible to keep it out of politics. It is there "in
all questions of the franchise, of the condition of the
masses, of nationality,"&mdash;all intimately linked with the
religious thought of the time, all part of God's
providential scheme for man. "I do not know," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
says, "speaking historically, a single great conquest
of the human spirit, a single important step for the
perfecting of human society, which has not had its
roots in a strong religious faith." "No true society
exists without a common faith and common purpose;
politics are the application, religion gives the principle."
Where this common faith is not, the mere will of the
majority means permanent instability and the oppression
of the rest; "without God, you can coerce, but you cannot
persuade; you may be tyrants in your turn, but
you cannot be educators or apostles."</p>

<p>Without religion, then,&mdash;deep, heartfelt, vitalising
religion,&mdash;there can be no true community. Materialism
had been tried, and had failed;&mdash;failed because it
was "an individualist, cold, calculating doctrine, that
slowly, infallibly extinguished every spark of high
thinking or free life, that first plunged men into the
worship of success, then made them slaves of triumphant
violence and the accomplished fact." It killed enthusiasm
in the individual; it killed true greatness in a
nation. Bare ethics had been tried, "but no morality
can endure or bring forth life, without a heaven and
a dogma to support it." "No, man needs more than
simple ethics; he craves to solve his doubts, to slake
his thirsting for a future; he wants to know whence
he comes and whither he goes." Men had tried
philosophy, and indeed philosophy, that took humanity
and not the individual for its study, was "the science
of the law of life"; but by itself it was a barren rock,
where life could find no resting-place. "Heresy is
sacred," but only as the transient stage between a
lower and a higher faith. Philosophy can "analyse
and anatomise and dissect," but it has no breath of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
life to "decree duty or push men to deeds by giving
ethics a new strength and grandeur." The needs of
the age are less intellectual than spiritual. "What
we want, what the people want, what the age is
crying for, that it may find an issue from this slough
of selfishness and doubt and negation, is a faith, a
faith in which our souls may cease to err in search
of individual ends, may march together in the knowledge
of one origin, one law, one goal." And such a
faith, and only such a faith, will give the solid, strong
convictions and the energy and unity, by which alone
society can be healed. "Any strong faith, that rises on
the wreck of the old, exhausted creeds, will transform
the existing social order, since every strong belief must
needs apply itself to every branch of human activity;
because always, in every age, earth has sought conformity
with the heaven in which it believed; because
all Humanity repeats under different formulas and in
different degrees the words of the Lord's Prayer of
Christendom: Thy kingdom come on earth as it is
in heaven."</p>

<p>Where shall this faith be found,&mdash;this living,
vitalising faith, for which the age is groping, for want
of which its aspiration and its efforts are in vain?
Does Christianity supply it? Mazzini asked the
question reverently and tenderly. Religion, he says, is
above and independent of creeds, but every creed is
sacred, for each has added to man's knowledge of God
and of himself. However incomplete a faith, so it be
a faith indeed, it helps to hallow life. He felt his
a spiritual kinship more with Catholic priest and Protestant
pastor, who lighted earth with broken rays of
the divine, than with the sceptic, who would shut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
out God and immortality, enthusiasm and love.
Reverently, then, he tested Christianity. For the
superstructures, indeed, that Catholics and Protestants
had built upon the Christianity of Christ, he felt
respect and sympathy, but little love. He had his
special grievances against the Papacy for the evil
work it had done in his own country, and he hated
it, as only an Italian of his day could hate it. He
held it to be irrevocably doomed: doomed, since
the Reformation took the North from it;&mdash;doomed,
"because it has betrayed its mission to protect the
weak, because for three centuries and a half it has
committed fornication with the princes of this world,
because at the bidding of every evil and unbelieving
government it has crucified Jesus afresh in the name
of egoism,"&mdash;doomed, because it stood apart from the
great humanitarian movements of the century, the
freeing of Greece and Italy, the emancipation of the
blacks;&mdash;doomed for the root sin, of which these
were but consequences, that it had become "a
phantasm of religion," "without faith or power or
mission." It had missed the meaning of Christ's
teaching; it had sinned against the Holy Spirit, and
there was no forgiveness for it. "God will provide
for the abominated idolatry, God, who breaks all idols
that were and are and shall be." Sometimes he was
confident, that, before the century was out, the Papacy
would be extinct. And yet, in spite of all, he respected
what had been a great fact in the history of
religion. Like every strong belief, it had in its time
done high service for humanity, it had had its share of
the noble and sublime and potent. "I remember it
all and bow myself before your past." And die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
though it must, he would it should die nobly, "like
the sun in the great ocean," rejoicing that God's great
design bade it make place for a more perfect faith.</p>

<p>For Protestantism his feeling was colder both in its
sympathies and antipathies. His Catholic training,
his craving for formal unity, made it difficult for him
to read it sympathetically; and he saw it chiefly in
its defects,&mdash;its exaggeration of the individual, its
rejection of tradition, its sectarianism, its "indefinite
dismembering of the common thought." He recognised
somewhat, though imperfectly, the political and
social work, which was indissolubly bound up with
Puritanism; "'God and the People,'" he said in one
of his letters to English working men, "were the
inspirers of your Cromwell." As Catholicism had
one side of the truth in its respect for tradition,
so Protestantism had the other in its assertion of
individual interpretation, and in this it had apprehended
the essence of Christianity more truly than
Catholicism had done. But though Protestants were
slowly learning the value of tradition, the preeminence
of Humanity over man, they still magnified the
individual, till their creed had become a doctrine of
material and spiritual selfishness, which must logically
develop into pure materialism. He charged it with inspiring
the inhumanity and anarchy of the <i>laissez-faire</i>
economy. It had made the salvation of the individual
soul the end of life; and thus it had sundered religion
from society, and dwarfed the all-embracing plan of
God to the puny borders of a loveless pietism.</p>

<p>But when Mazzini passes from Catholicism and
Protestantism to Christ, his attitude is one of infinite
reverence and love. His close knowledge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Gospels, his native kinship with their spirit, had
brought him very near the mind of Christ, and he
spoke of Him in beautiful and tender words. Christ's
"was the soul most full of love, of holiest virtue, most
inspired by God and by the Future, that men have
ever hailed upon this earth." He "came for all; he
spoke to all and for all. He lifted up the People
and died for it." "I love Jesus," he once wrote in a
private letter, "as the man who has loved the most
all mankind, servants and masters, rich and poor,
Brahmins and Helots or Parias." "In Jesus," so he
wrote to the Oecumenical Council, "we worship the
Founder of an age that freed the individual, the
Apostle of the unity of law,&mdash;that law which he
understood more fully than did any of the generations
before him,&mdash;the Prophet of the equality of souls:
and we bow ourselves before him, as the man who
among all we know of loved the most, whose life, an
unexampled harmony between thought and practice,
proclaimed the holy doctrine of sacrifice, henceforth to
be the everlasting foundation of all religion and all
virtue; but we do not cancel the woman-born in
God, we do not raise him where we cannot hope to
join him; we would love him as the brother who was
better than us all, not worship him and fear him as
pitiless judge and intolerant tyrant of the future." In
Christ's teaching he found many of the moral and
social truths that were dearest to him. "Does not
every word of the Gospel breathe the spirit of liberty
and equality, of that war with evil and injustice and
falsehood, that inspires our work?" The cross was
the symbol of "the one true immortal virtue, the
sacrifice of self for others." "Unity of faith, love for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
one another, human brotherhood, activity in well-doing,
the doctrine of sacrifice, the doctrine of equality,
the abolition of aristocracy, the perfecting of the
individual, liberty,&mdash;all are summed up in Christ's
words, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy
neighbour as thyself,' and 'Whosoever will be chief
among you, let him be your servant.'" Christ's teaching
had inspired each struggle for truth from the
Crusades to Lepanto, had destroyed feudalism, was
destroying now the aristocracy of blood; Poles and
Greeks had marched to freedom's battles under the
flag of Jesus and His mother. And, above all, Christ
gave the promise of indefinite religious progress,&mdash;a
promise, which closed the mouths of those who would
arbitrarily pin men to a fixed doctrine. 'The Spirit
of truth shall abide with you for ever, ... and shall
teach you all things.' "On the eve of his accepted
sacrifice, when his mighty love for his brethren lit up
the darkness of the future, he had sight of the continuous
revelation of the Spirit through humanity."
This was the 'eternal gospel' of the mystics of the
middle ages; and Christ's promise stood true to-day.
"God forgive you," he wrote to a Catholic friend,
"you do not understand Christ,&mdash;Christ who died
that humanity may some day free itself to rise to
God by its own strength."</p>

<p>He paused anxiously before he declared himself no
Christian. His temperament and outlook on life
were essentially Christian; he tried to read new
meanings into Christian doctrines; words of Christian
prayer came naturally to his lips; Christmas Day was
"sacred" to him. Several times in early life he
cherished schemes of reform within the church; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
some years he doubted how far religious development
could be built on Christian foundations, whether the
new church would be "an application of Christianity"
or "a religion to succeed" it. At all events Christian
ethics would remain. "The morality of Christ is
eternal; humanity will add to it, but will not take
from it one word." And for long yet Christianity
would abide, the greatest of the creeds. "This will
reach you on Christmas Day," he wrote to an English
friend. "I am not a Christian, I belong to what I
believe to be a still purer and higher Faith; but
its time has not yet come; and until that day the
Christian manifestation remains the most sacred revelation
of the ever-onward progressing spirit of
mankind."</p>

<p>But that its doctrine and its cult must some day
pass, that its ethics needed supplementing, he had
convinced himself, at all events as early as his Swiss
days. He wasted little time in attacking particular
articles of the Christian faith, for analytical criticism
was always hateful to him. But he thought it had
certain essential imperfections, because of which it
failed, and was bound to fail to content the present
reach of human knowledge or inspire men's activities.
He charged it, firstly, with not sanctifying the things
of earth. The church taught that the world was evil,
life here an expiation, heaven the soul's true home.
At one time he appealed against the church to Christ's
own teaching, to texts that spoke of God's will being
done on earth, of power given to Christ in earth, of
the promise that the meek should inherit the earth.
In later life he qualified this reading of the gospel.
Jesus, "a soul blessed with such mighty love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
perfect harmony between thought and action," could
not fail to realise the harmony of earth and heaven.
But "while he stood and stands alone, supreme over
all other great religious reformers in everything that
concerns the heart and affections, his intellectual grasp
did not extend beyond the requirements of a single
epoch." At the time in which he lived, he "saw no
possible mission for the sake of the brethren whom
he loved, save by moral regeneration, by creating a
country of freemen and equals in heaven. He wished
to show mankind how it could find salvation and
redemption in spite of and in opposition to the world."
Great Christian statesmen and thinkers of a later time,&mdash;Gregory
VII. and Thomas Aquinas,&mdash;had tried to
bring the temporal under the spiritual law. But they
had failed, and the normal Christianity of the day
was fatally divorced from religion and politics and art
and science. It left the bigger part of life without
God's law to guide it. It told men to renounce the
world, when their duty was to live in it and battle in
it and better it.</p>

<p>Christianity again came short, because it left out of
ken the collective life of the race. The conception was
an impossible one at the time in which Christ lived;
and its absence maimed men's knowledge of God, and
shortened their power to attain to the Divine Ideal.
Christianity pointed, indeed, to "salvation, that is
perfection"; but it recognised no instrument beyond
"the weak, unequal, isolated, ineffective strength of the
individual." Mazzini's criticism came to this: Christianity
tells each man to perfect himself by his own
strength and God's; but his spiritual growth is conditioned
by the growth of the men around him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
therefore his own perfecting depends on the progress
of the race, the common search for good, that links
all men together and the generations to one another.
Mazzini always regarded the French Revolution as the
political expression, the "daughter" of Christianity,
and there the depreciation of the race, the exaggeration
of the individual had borne their necessary fruit of
moral selfishness and social anarchy. Yet again,
though Christ had promised the continuous teaching
of his Spirit, ever leading to new truth, the doctrine
of redemption was inconsistent with any theory of
progress. There was no Fall; man had begun at the
bottom and had been tending upwards ever since.
Salvation was for men, not from a single, isolated
act, but from the slow, unceasing, inevitable working
of the providential scheme. The individual came
nearer the divine, not by faith in Christ's sacrifice,
but by his own works, by sacrifice of self, by faith in
the "ideal that every man is called to incarnate in
himself." And because of these imperfections in its
theory of life, Christianity had ceased to be a vitalising
force. For some it had become an ethical system, for
others a philosophy, while men needed a religion.
Politics and art and science had gone their own ways.
Christian morality knew not patriotism. Charity was
its only remedy for social wrongs, and charity was
impotent to stop the springs of poverty. Men gave
lip-service to Christ's teaching, but it had no binding
influence on their lives. It offered no solution for
their perplexities; it was no longer a faith that could
move mountains or remould the modern world. Its
day had gone, and all the efforts of neo-Christians or
Christian Socialists or Old Catholics to make it answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
to modern needs were bound to fail, as the neo-Platonists
had failed in their day to galvanise paganism. "Jesus
warned you, when on earth," he said to "the Anglo-Saxon
Christian Socialists," "that you cannot put new
wine into old bottles."</p>

<p>Such was Mazzini's criticism of Christianity, not
always consistent with itself, sometimes confounding
Christ's thought with others' perversions of it, sometimes
failing to recognise how many-sided a phenomenon
is Christianity, sometimes inaccurately tracing
its actual results in history and modern life. His
attitude towards it may be summed up thus. He
retained its belief in the omnipotence of the spiritual;
its faith in God and in His providential working; its
supreme veneration for the character and moral teaching
of Jesus; its insistence on moral perfection and
not material interest as the end of life; its call to love
and sacrifice of self; its belief in immortality; its
aspiration to the Church Universal. He rejected
the divinity of Christ, the doctrine of a mediator, the
antagonism between matter and spirit and the consequent
neglect of the things of earth; its inability
to grasp God's law of progress; its non-acceptance
(though the Church had partially recognised it) of
Humanity as the interpreter of that law.</p>

<p>But the new faith, which was to grow out of and
supplement Christianity, must have its doctrines too,
its positive basis of belief. "There is no life in the
void. Life is faith in something, a system of secure
beliefs, grounded on an immutable foundation, which
defines the end, the destiny of man, and embraces all
his faculties to point them to that end." Mankind,
he said, is weary of negations, of the hustling conflict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
of opinions. "We must prepare for it an abode for
the day of rest,&mdash;something on earth, where it may
lay its weary head,&mdash;something in heaven on which
its eyes may stay,&mdash;a tent to shield it from the storm,
a spring to quench its thirst in the vast unbounded
desert where it travels." Dogma is essential; it is
ever "sovereign over practical morality," for "morality
is only its consequence, its application, its translation
into practice." By dogma he meant "a body of ideas,
which, starting from a fixed point, embraces all human
faculties and employs them for the conquest of a positive,
practical end, which is for the good of the majority;
the exposition of a principle and its consequences in
relation to life's manifestation and operations in the
moral and the industrial world, both for the individual
and for society." The thinker apprehends it, science
and society prepare the medium for its adoption, the
best and wisest incarnate it in their lives, then it
"enters the soul of the many and becomes a religious
axiom." In other words it is an ethical and political
system, so based on the eternal verities of life, so
penetrated by the spiritual sense of the race, that
it ceases to be a cold and abstract code, and takes
the warmth and colour of religion, compelling men's
souls and pushing them irresistibly to social duty.</p>

<p>What then is the body of doctrine for the Church
of the future, as Mazzini conceived it? First, as the
root of all, belief in God, "the author of all existence,
the living, absolute thought, of which our world is a
ray and the universe an incarnation"; "a sphere
inviolable, eternal, supreme over all humanity, independent
of chance or error or blind and interrupted
operation." God, then, exists objectively, as maker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and ruler of the universe. Man discovers God; he does
not create Him. In his criticism of Renan, Mazzini
attacks any theory of the subjectivity of the Divine.
Pantheism (that is, the "materialist pantheism" of
Spinoza, not the "spiritual pantheism" of St Paul
and Wordsworth and Shelley) confounds subject and
object, good and evil, and leaves no place for Providence
or human liberty; it is a "philosophy of the squirrel
in the cage," condemning mankind to go for ever
rotating in a circle. Deism is a "sordid" creed,
which relegates God to heaven and ignores his ever-operating
life in creation. Mazzini gives no clue how
he would have reconciled an all-creating Deity,&mdash;author
therefore of good and evil,&mdash;with a beneficent
and loving Providence.</p>

<p>He finds the proofs of an actual, objective God, first,
in man himself, in the universal intuition of the Divine.
"God exists. God lives in our conscience, in the
conscience of Humanity, in the Universe around us.
Our conscience calls to him in our most solemn
moments of sorrow and joy. He who would deny
God before a starry night, before the graves of his
dearest ones, before the martyr's scaffold, is a very
wretched or a very guilty man." The fact that we
aspire to the best and infinite proves that there is
a best and infinite, that is God. And, next, the fact
of existence bears witness to an intelligent creator.
"God exists because we exist." "Call it God or what
you like," he once said, "there is life which we have
not created, but which is given." "The Universe
displays him in its order and harmony, in the intelligent
design shown in its working and its law." And
this law is "one and immutable." "Everything is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
preordained"; "God and law are identical terms";
"'chance' has no meaning, and was only invented to
express man's ignorance." "There can be no miracle,
nothing supernatural, no possible violation of the laws
that rule the Universe"; though he realised how big
is the unknown of nature, and his rejection of the
supernatural did not prevent him from being a mystic.
But God is not only intellect but love, not only Lord
but Educator. His law embraces Humanity as well
as nature, the moral as well as the physical world.
He manifests himself "in the intelligent design, that
regulates the life of Humanity" and leads man ever
upwards towards perfection. "Everything, from the
grain of sand to the plant, from the plant to Man,
has its own law; how then can Humanity be without
its law?"</p>

<p>Mazzini seems to have recognised the difficulty of
reconciling the oneness and eternity of law with an
ever-active Providence, which concerned itself, for
instance, with present-day problems of democracy and
nationality. He found a solution in making the law
consist in an inevitable tendency to progress, both in the
material and, still more, in the spiritual world. The law
of Progress, which perhaps he developed from Lessing,
is "a supreme formula of the creative activity, eternal,
omnipotent, universal as itself." His 'Progress' is
not equivalent to 'evolution.' He formulated it, of
course, before Darwin's day; so far as I know, he
never refers to Darwinism, and probably never studied
it. If he had, it would certainly have been to condemn
it. But he would have attacked it, not from the
scientific side, but on <i>à priori</i> grounds. Progress, he
would have said, rules the material world, but it rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
it through the spiritual, by virtue of an inherent God-implanted
tendency and the operation of the human
will. He would have rejected as derogatory to the
divine idea an evolution, which results from the
struggle of unthinking and non-moral forces. He
condemned unsparingly, as we shall see, the explanation
of social facts by the bare brute struggle of
individuals or the development of material phenomena.
Progress is essentially a moral phenomenon, and postulates
the search, not for self, but for self-sacrifice. It
is "the slow, but necessary, inevitable development of
every germ of good, of every holy idea." Sometimes,
indeed, he is trapped by the ambiguity of 'self-realisation,'
and speaks of "the instinct and necessity, which
urges every living being to the fuller development of
all the germs, the faculties, the forces, the life within
it." But it is clear that he is always really thinking
of the development of good alone. God's plan "slowly,
progressively makes man divine." Whither Humanity
ultimately goes, we know not; but we know there is
no limit to the march; and every age, every religion,
each new philosophy enlarges its apprehension of the
end.</p>

<p>He curiously dovetails personal immortality into the
doctrine. For the individual soul the process of perfecting
goes on beyond the limits of this world. Life
"here-down" (as he called it in English) is so short, so
full of imperfection, that the soul cannot in its earthly
pilgrimage climb the ladder that leads to God. And
yet intuition and tradition tell us that the ideal will
be reached some day, somewhere; in words, that
almost suggest that he had read the parallel passage
in Wordsworth, he speaks of memory as the consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of the soul's progress up from earlier existences;
love would be a mockery, if it did not last beyond the
grave; the unity of the race implies a link between
the living and the dead; science teaches there is no
death but only transformation. He held passionately
to his faith in immortality, and he believed that the
dear ones he had lost were watching over him and
bringing his best aspirations. The individual soul, he
thought, progresses through a series of re-incarnations,
each leading it to a more perfect development, and
the rapidity of its advance depends on its own purification.
And as the individual has his progress through
a series of existences, so collective man progresses
ever through the human generations. "No, God
eternal, thy word is not all spoken, thy thought not
yet revealed in all its fulness. It still creates, and
will create through long ages beyond the grasp of
human reckoning. The ages, that are past, have
revealed but fragments to us. Our mission is not
finished. We hardly know its source, we do not know
its final end; time and our discoveries only extend its
borders. From age to age it ascends to destinies
unknown to us, seeking its own law, of which we read
but a few lines. From initiative to initiative, through
the series of thy progressive incarnations, it purifies
and extends the formula of Sacrifice; it feels for its
own way; it learns thy faith, eternally progressive."
If once we recognised this progressive evolution of
religion and morals, there would be no room for pure
scepticism; we should see that an expired form of
faith is not wrong but imperfect, that it needs not
destroying but supplementing. "Every religion instils
into the human soul one more drop of the universal life."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>But does not this mean fatalism,&mdash;the same fatalism,
with which he charged the Christian doctrine of redemption,
the fatalism, with which he would have
charged the evolutionists, had he known them? If
the progress of humanity is preordained, what need
for man to use his puny powers? Mazzini met the
difficulty thus. True, evil cannot permanently triumph,
God's progress must go on; but its quicker or slower
realisation is in our hands. "The slow unfolding of
history proceeds under the continuous action of two
factors, the work of individuals and the providential
scheme. Time and space are ours; we can quicken
progress or retard it, we cannot stop it." And this,
because progress, being essentially a moral phenomenon,
must be realised in the world of thought and will,
before it can be translated into practice. Mazzini did
not seriously concern himself with the metaphysics of
determinism; he took the common-sense position that
the will is free; "no philosophic sophisms," he said,
"can cancel the testimony of remorse and martyrdom."
It depends on a man's choice of good or evil, whether
he approaches nearer the ideal in himself, and therefore
whether, so far as his influence lies, progress is realised
in society. Thus, in his strained and inconclusive
argument, God's providential working is reconciled
both with human free will and the oneness of law.</p>

<p>Progress, then!&mdash;onwards to the great Ideal, the
ideal which "stands in God, outside and independent
of ourselves," which as yet we know but darkly, but
which every generation sees more clearly; fixed,
therefore, and "absolute in the Divine Idea," but
gradually revealed to man, "approached" but never
"reached" in this life, ever provisional and shifting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
us as knowledge grows. The world is no mere necessary
sequence of material phenomena, but a spiritual
stream, that, swift or sluggish be its course, flows
irresistibly to God. The existing fact is not the
law; choice between good and evil, heroism, sacrifice
are not illusions; conscience, the intuition of the ideal,
the power of will, and moral force are ultimate and
mastering spiritual facts. The divine design controls
it all, and man has liberty to help God's plan. And
he who knows this, knows that "a supreme power
guards the road, by which believers journey towards
their goal," and he will be "bold with God through
God." The crusaders' cry 'God wills it' is for him,
and his are the courage and consistency and power of
sacrifice, that come to those who know they battle on
the side of God. It was this conviction that Mazzini
wished his followers to have, when he pleaded that
Young Italy should be as a religion. For "political
parties fall and die; religious parties never die till
they have conquered."</p>

<p>But how shall man search for the ideal, how learn
the providential design? Mazzini has his answer
clear: "tradition and conscience,"<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> or, as we may
translate them, experience and intuition, "are the
two wings given to the human soul to reach to truth."
First, then, the individual consciousness and that in a
two-fold sense. Truth is truth only to the individual,
when he apprehends it for himself. Sometimes
Mazzini speaks as if he accepted the whole Protestant
doctrine of individual judgment, and in a sense he does.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Each man must prove by his own consciousness every
interpretation of God's law, whether it be true or not.
But this gift of judgment only comes by righteousness.
"In moments of holy thought something of the great
flood of man's knowledge of God's law may come to
every man." To learn it, he must "purify himself
from low passion, from every guilty inclination, from
every idolatrous superstition"; and truth will come
"in the most secret aspirations of the soul, in the
instincts of itself, that hover round in supreme hours
of affection and devotion." But, though Mazzini does
not very clearly distinguish, he seems generally to be
thinking of something more. It is for the consciousness
not only to apprehend and appropriate for the
individual truths already known to the race, but sometimes
it is its privilege to spell a new line of God's
law. Glimpses of new truth may come to the collective
intuition of a people. There are times, when
"the spirit of God descends upon the gathered
multitudes," and <i>vox populi</i> is <i>vox Dei</i>. He would
deny the right of spiritual discovery to a people
enslaved by low, material impulses; but in a nation
moved by some great aspiration, when thought strikes
thought, and enthusiasm kindles enthusiasm, there
truth will probably be found. But though in such
times of faith and struggle the people has its "great
collective intuitions," though sometimes "the pale,
modest star that God has placed in simple bosoms"
comes nearer truth than genius comes, it is normally
for the best and wisest to discover truth. Only men
of holy lives and genius are God's "born interpreters";
his apostles, those "who love their brethren most and
are ready to suffer for their love, and those on whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
God has bestowed surpassing gifts of intellect, provided
that their intellect is virtuous and desires the good." But
even such as these can find truth only by interrogating
the dim silent workings of the people's mind. Light
comes to no man by his own unaided effort; and the
solitary thinker may mistake his own conceit for truth.
"Great men can only spring from a great people, just
as an oak, however high it may tower above every other
tree in the forest, depends on the soil whence it derives
its nourishment. The soil must be enriched by countless
decaying leaves."</p>

<p>But the untested intuition, whether of man of
genius or people, is by itself no sufficient criterion
of truth. Every heresy has its martyrs. There is
a more unerring interpreter of God's law, known
imperfectly to Catholicism, but neglected by Protestantism
and the individualist schools of the day,&mdash;the
consciousness of the race, checked and corrected
and perfected by each succeeding generation, the
"common consensus of humanity," "the tradition,
not of one school or one religion or one age, but
of all the schools and all religions and all the ages
in their succession," for "no one man or people or
school can presume to discover all the law of God."
The seeker after truth will find it most surely in "the
severe study of the universal tradition, which is life's
manifestation in Humanity." Humanity (the conception
of which he seems to have derived from Vico
and Herder), "the living word of God," "the collective
and continuous being," is "the only interpreter of
God's law." "Humanity," said a thinker of the last
century,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> "is a man who is ever learning. Individuals
die; but the truth they thought, the good they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
wrought, is not lost with them; Humanity garners
it, and the men who walk over their graves, have
their profit from it. Each of us is born to-day in
an atmosphere of ideas and beliefs, that are the
work of all Humanity before us; each of us brings
unconsciously some element, more or less valuable,
for the life of Humanity that comes after. The
education of Humanity grows like those Eastern
pyramids, to which each passer-by adds his stone.
We pass, the travellers of a day, called away to complete
our individual education elsewhere; the education
of Humanity shines by flashes in each one of us,
but unveils its full radiance slowly, progressively,
continuously in Humanity. From one task to
another, from one faith to another, step by step
Humanity conquers a clearer vision of its life, its
mission, of God and of his law." And here again
comes strength. "It matters little," he replied to
Carlyle, "that <i>our</i> individual powers be of the smallest
amount in relation to the object to be attained; we
know that the powers of millions of men, our brethren,
will succeed to the work after us, in the same track,&mdash;we
know that the object attained, be it when it
may, will be the result of <i>all</i> our efforts combined."
But he who would have this strength, must needs
respect Humanity's tradition, must recognise that the
race is more likely to be right than his own poor
intellect. He turned angrily on the "barbarian"
schools, that would sweep away the past, and create
Humanity anew on some arbitrary plan. Humanity
spurns builders of utopias; and preachers of new
principles, the masses fervent for some new idea,
must prove their beliefs by the infallible test of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
tradition. Mazzini hardly recognised how difficult
and vague and diverse might be the detailed interpretation
of tradition, and he was never very modest
in making his own inductions. He believed that
history proves that there are certain "immortal elements
of human nature,"&mdash;education, fatherland, liberty,
association, family, property, religion; and the theorist,
who offends any one of these, is in conflict with
God's law. In the conjunction, then, of these two
criteria and no otherwise stands the discovery of
the truth. Neither suffices without the other; and
therefore Catholicism and Protestantism, each of which
had apprehended one alone, are incomplete. Tradition
by itself leads to stagnation; intuition alone to chance
and anarchy. But "where you find the general permanent
voice of humanity agreeing with the voice of your
conscience, be sure that you hold in your grasp something
with absolute truth,&mdash;gained and for ever yours."</p>

<p>It will be noted that Mazzini parts himself from
the intuitive school, when he admits experience as
the surer criterion of truth, when, again, he says that
the intellect is necessary to verify the instincts of
consciousness. On the other hand he is a pure
intuitionist in his conception of the function of
genius, for genius meant with him something other
far than 'the infinite capacity of taking pains'; it
was a God-given, almost mystical faculty, that saw
truth by its own natural, unaided light, that possessed
her forcibly, not wooed her timidly. He is an intuitionist
again when he holds, as obviously he does
hold, that it is for the pure in heart to see God,
that religious and ethical enquiry depends for its
results on the cultivation of the moral sense, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
therefore more on the moral than on the intellectual
development of the enquirer. And, even when he
sides with the opposite school, it does not mean
that he trusts to any scientific process of ratiocination.
He has more confidence in the unconscious reasoning,
by which the race has gathered its experience, and
which allows no room for the errors of the solitary
thinker. He did not neglect metaphysics, but he was
little influenced by them, and he would have sided
with 'the vulgar' against 'the philosophers.'</p>

<p class="p2">Mazzini's conception of Humanity was essentially
related to his craving for religious and moral unity.
Fighter though he was ever, and recognising somewhat
the value of "the holy conflict of ideas," he
did not see how much in an imperfect age progress
depends upon the clash of creeds and conflict of
opinions. He was so weary of debate, so confident
that others must come to the same truth that he had.
As far as humanity had learnt God's law, all should
bow to it; and he looked to a true national education
to generate this unity of faith. As unity was the law
of God's universe, so unity was the condition of
humanity's advance. Without it "there may be movement,
but it is not uniform or concentrated." Therefore
"the world thirsts for unity," "democracy tends
to unity," and every great religion must of necessity
strive to be catholic. But now "discord is everywhere,"&mdash;creeds
that curse one another, warring states,
class hatreds, party bitterness, the search for truth
itself a source of conflict. It is time to end this
wasteful strife, and march together, "reverently seeking
the future city, a new heaven and a new earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
which may unite in one, in love of God and man, in
faith in a common aim, all those, who tossed between
fears of the present and doubtings of the future, now
stray in intellectual and moral anarchy." "We must
found moral unity, the Catholicism of humanity," "the
unity of belief that Christ promised for all peoples,"
"a unity which binds the sects in one sole people of
believers, and on the churches and conventicles and
chapels raises the great temple, Humanity's Pantheon
to God."</p>

<p>The new faith, like the old, must have its visible
embodiment. "Sacred," he said, "is the church, but
not a false church." At the time of the Roman
Republic, a liberal cleric warned the Catholics that
"if the church did not march with the people, the
people would march without the church, aye, outside it
and against it." "Against the church, no!" Mazzini
replied; "we will march from the church of the past
to the church of the future, from the dead church to
the living, to the church of freemen and equals.
There is room enough for such a church betwixt the
Vatican and Capitol." Sometimes he thought that
the new church would have its cult, a cult "which
would gather believers together in feasts of equality
and love," where men of saintly lives would preach
plain truths of duty and inspire enthusiasm. And in
some undefined way the authority of the church was
to be supreme in the state. Gregory VII.'s principles,
he says, were right, but erred in the application.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
"Religion will be the soul, the thought of the new
state." "Power is one; religion, the law of the spirit,
sits in the seat of government; its interpreters, the
temporal power, reduce it to practice." It is true that
till men find a common faith, while the existing church
is a church only in name, the state must protect itself
by the separation of the two. But the Cavourian 'free
church in a free state' means religious indifference
and "an atheist law"; and a higher order will
terminate "the absurd divorce between the temporal
and spiritual." In his later years it seems to have
been a fixed idea with him to get some kind of state
creed recognised by the Italian parliament. Some
day "a few men, reverenced for their doctrine and
virtue, their intellect and love and sacrifice of self,"
would form a "supreme Council" for Europe and
America, proclaiming new truths and the common
duties of the nations; while under them would sit
national councils to define the several duties of each
people. He seems to have expected that at first
these councils would have a voluntary basis outside
the state, but that eventually they would be recognised
by law as the supreme international and national
authorities, and, as such would be the authoritative
exponents of tradition and control education. And
with this reconciliation of the spiritual and temporal
the world would find that real authority, of which it
stood in need. For authority in itself was a good and
not an evil thing; and on the wreck of the existing
phantasms of authority, another would arise, democratic,
based on the common will, loving liberty and
progress, with virtue to initiate and inspire, the unexhausted
fountain of reform, correlating and organising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
men's various labours for the commonwealth. For
such an authority "the world is ever searching, and
save in it and through it, it has no life or progress."</p>

<p>That the new religion,&mdash;one which in its time must
pass too,&mdash;would come, he had no doubt. He looked
for the day when a Council of the best and wisest
(whether or not identical with the supreme European
council) would define the articles of the new faith. It
might be "a truly Oecumenical Council of virtuous intellects,"
or it might spring from one "free people,
which had found brotherhood in the worship of duty
and the ideal." It was the dream of his life that this
faith would issue forth from Rome,&mdash;Rome, the only
city to whose authority Europe had bowed, Rome, the
seat of the old false religion, whose fall must come ere
the new one could arise. But, whatever were the
more impatient hopes of earlier years, he came to
see that the dawn was yet afar. Long missionary
labours must come first. Still, the time, he thought,
was ripe at all events for a "church of the precursors,"
and gladly he would have led its builders. In younger
days, when the deliverance of Italy seemed near, he
prayed that God would let him give the rest of life to
the greater work. Afterwards, when the new Italy
delayed its coming, and age and weakness came ere
the first task was done, the dream of a missionary call
faded slowly away, to be cherished to the end as the
great unfulfilled ambition of his life.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV<br />
Duty</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p class="s08 hanging">
Morality depends on an Ideal&mdash;Criticism of the theory of Rights and
Utilitarianism&mdash;Happiness not the end of life&mdash;Life is a mission&mdash;Work
for the sake of Duty&mdash;Thought useless without action&mdash;Power
of the principle of Duty&mdash;Duties to self; family; country.
</p>

<p>On this religious foundation Mazzini constructed his
code of ethics,&mdash;Christian, very Christian in its spirit,
essentially modern in its application; the noblest
morality that has sought to answer to the needs of a
democratic society. The law of Progress judges all
action by the Ideal, and the sole standard of conduct
lies in what a man does that the Ideal may be better
realised in himself and others. Without the recognition
of such a universal law, demanding their cooperation
and conformity, there can be no common rule for
men; life becomes the resultant of clashing interests;
its line of advance, if advance there be, depends upon
mere chance. True education is impossible, because
there is no consensus on its aim; we come to value
character, as he complained that Carlyle did, not by
its goodness, but by its energy and persistence, whether
it be to good or evil ends. Everywhere in actual life,
the neglect of the Ideal means worship of brute force,
cowardly acquiescence in the existing fact, the absence
of all striving for a better state. But with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
apprehension of the Ideal and of the Divine law, three
things follow, incentive to progress. Every man has a
rule to guide his individual actions; men of good
will will associate their efforts for a common end; and
they can appeal to a supreme, positive law against
those who break it. "In the consciousness of your law
of life, which is the law of God, stands the foundation
of your morality, the rule of your actions and your
duties, the measure of your responsibility." "If there
be no Mind supreme over all human minds, who can
save us from the caprice of our fellows, should they
chance to be stronger than ourselves? If there be no
law, sacred and inviolable, not created by man, what
standard can we find to judge whether an act be just
or not? In the name of whom or what can we
protest against oppression and inequality? Without
God, we have no other law but Fact."</p>

<p>Mazzini lived too soon to have to meet a school
that denied morality, as that school is developed to-day.
But he found a numerous and powerful school,
that built morality on what he believed to be radically
wrong foundations. The theory of Rights, since the
precursors of the French Revolution popularized it,
had dominated Liberal thought, except for a handful
of thinkers,&mdash;Lamennais, Carlyle, Emerson. It had
had, he owned, its temporary value, as the necessary
rebellion against fatalism and immobility and privilege.
"It destroyed the empire of necessity"; it finally
asserted the dignity of the individual, so that "God's
creature might appear, ready to work, radiant with
power and will." "Only, it stopped short of God,"
for the ideal was hidden from it. Its work was to
destroy, and it was unfitted for an age that needed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
constructive code of ethics. Mazzini included Utilitarianism
in his condemnation, as a mere variant of
the principle. He knew that Bentham repudiated the
connection; but Bentham's criticism, he thought, was
aimed at Blackstone and the theorists of an imaginary
compact, not at a system, which based itself on the <i>à
priori</i> claims of the individual. The spirit and the
consequences were the same in both schools. Bentham
and the French alike appealed to the getting side of
man and not the giving; both thought of the individual
in his self-regarding rather than in his social
aspect; neither had an ideal or any imperative
binding law for men; both neglected the strongest
impulses to right action,&mdash;enthusiasm and love and
sense of duty. They supplied no guide for conduct;
they gave no definition of happiness, nor therefore of
what men's rights should be, and left each individual
to interpret them by his own fancy. They gave no
answer to the question, For what are men to use
their liberty? though on the answer depended the
whole value of rights. Thus happiness, left without a
theory of life's purpose to define it, slided easily into
the satisfaction of man's lower part. "Any theory of
happiness will make men fall, soon or late, into the
suicide of the noblest elements of human nature, will
make them go, like Faust, to seek life's elixir in the
witch's kitchen." Man's material interests must indeed
be cared for, but not for their own sake; they were
only instruments to higher ends; they must be
satisfied because, only when men have leisure and
education and a decent home, the moral life has room
to grow. If they became the end and not the means,
they led to torpor of the nation's soul, to the paralysis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
that comes, when men care for power and money only,
and a country measures its greatness by its riches and
brute strength. The whole position was a false one.
No moral theory could work, that made happiness the
end of life. The Utilitarians mistook the incident of
the journey for the end. The spiritual side of man,&mdash;his
social instincts, his yearnings after righteousness,
the pure uncalculating love that gives up life for duty,&mdash;all
were outside their scheme. "Martyrdom! Your
theory has no inheritance in it. Jesus escapes your
logic; Socrates, if you are consistent, must seem to
you, as Plato did to Bentham, a sublime fool." Why
should men die for their fellows, why suffer prison,
exile, poverty, if happiness be the end of life? Why
should they toil on, knowing they would not see their
labour's fruits, to make life better for a future generation?</p>

<p>Thus the theory supplied no principle of moral
action. You cannot, he would say, by any theory of
rights make men unselfish. He knew that when a
man thinks of happiness, he will not be impartial
between his own happiness and other men's, that
directly he balances his rights against those of his
fellows, he will, however unconsciously, weight the
scales in his own favour. It was impossible, he
thought, on utilitarian principles to make men work
for the happiness of the many. The principle at once
sets men thinking on the selfish side, and makes them
dole their good deeds with a thrifty hand. "You have
taught the rich man," he said, "that society was constituted
only to assure his rights, and you ask him
then to sacrifice them all for the advancement of a
class, with which he has no ties either of affection or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
custom. He refuses. Will you call him bad? Why
should he consent? He is only logical." Mazzini
often quoted the fate of fellow-revolutionists, who
began life with generous impatience to fight the wrong,
but when failure came and disillusion, could not say
farewell to joy, and balanced self and duty, till
"scepticism twined its serpent coils around them," and
he "saw that saddest of all things, the slow death of
a soul." "For God's sake," he wrote to an English
friend on the education of his son, "do not teach him
any Benthamite theory about happiness either individual
or collective. A creed of individual happiness
would make him an egotist: a creed of collective
happiness will reach the same result soon or late. He
will perhaps dream Utopias, fight for them, whilst
young; then, when he will find that he cannot realise
rapidly the dream of his soul, he will turn back to
himself and try to conquer his own happiness: sink
into egotism." Christ taught another way. "When
he came and changed the face of the world, he did not
speak of rights to the rich, who had no need to win
them, nor to the poor, who would perhaps have
imitated the rich and abused them. He did not
speak of utility or self-interest to a race corrupted by
self-interest and utility. He spoke of Duty; he spoke
of Love and Sacrifice and Faith; he said that he only
should be first, who had helped all men by his works.
And when these words were whispered in the ear of
a dead society, they gave it life, they won the millions,
they won the world, and advanced the education of
mankind one step onward."</p>

<p>And,&mdash;as a final criticism,&mdash;the theory of rights
solved nothing. Mazzini did not waste argument on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the automatic identity of public and private interests.
Rights jostled against rights, the happiness of one man
or one class against another's. The theory could not
reconcile them or make peace between the jarring
interests; rather, it made war,&mdash;"war not of blood
but of gold and trickery; less manly than the other
kind of war but equally destructive; a ruthless war,
in which the strong inevitably crush the weak and
inexperienced." He attacked the whole economy of
free contract, which made the workman's condition
depend not on equity, but on the mere brute conflict
of opposing rights, and resulted, he believed, of
necessity in the workman's defeat. What good were
rights to men, who were too poor or ignorant to use
them? "Why do I speak to you of your duties
before I speak to you of your rights?" he said to
Italian working men in 1847. Because, he answered,
the theory of rights has triumphed for half a century,
liberty has increased, wealth has multiplied, but the
condition of the people grows steadily worse in almost
every country.</p>

<p>Mazzini's criticism was aimed at Bentham; had he
read the later Utilitarians, as apparently he never did,
he would no doubt have owned that some of his
arguments had no application to them. Happiness
implies a definition of happiness, and therefore an
ideal; and that ideal may be as high as was Mazzini's
own. He made a theoretical mistake in not distinguishing
between the object and the motive of life;
though, apart from this, he would have said that the
desire of others' good must be, not, as in the Utilitarian
theory, one of life's motives, but <i>the</i> motive. But
he was always essentially a moralist, whose business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
was to find a practical, popular, effective rule of
conduct. He knew that the search for happiness
meant the search for pleasure, and that the search for
pleasure ends in "impotence and nothingness"; that
the difficulty is not so much to make men know the
good, as to make them in actual conduct rate the
higher good above the lower; and that they will not do
this if happiness is their object, since the average man
will then prefer the immediate and easy happiness to
the remoter and more difficult, still less will sacrifice his
own happiness for that of others. "I should like," he
says, "to look for the answer to the problem in a good
mother's advice to her child. There you would
certainly find utility condemned as a basis of education.
Mothers know that, if happiness were made the
object of life down here, life almost always would
be only too much a bitter irony." As for the individual,
so for the many; and to bid the masses seek
for pleasure without reference to the higher ends of
life, was to lay up bitterness and vanity for them and
evil for the nation. And no hedonism, no theory of
rights, could supply an operating rule for conduct.
Perhaps he underrated the value of the sense of individual
rights, and did not see how in an imperfect
society, where nobler rules are faint or wanting, it may
give strength to human dignity and kill the slave and
coward in men. But he knew that it could not make
them live and work for others. He had gone through
it all in his own experience; he had had unsurpassed
opportunities for judging the springs of action in other
men, and he knew that there was nothing here to
inspire to steady, strenuous social service.</p>

<p>And so he met the theory with an uncompromising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
repudiation of it all. "Man has one right only, to be free
from obstacles that prevent the unimpeded fulfilment
of his duties." Life is no search for happiness, whether
"by railway shares, selfishness, contemplation," or otherwise.
"Our aim is not the greatest possible happiness,
but, as Carlyle said, the greatest possible nobleness."
"Pain and happiness, ill fortune and good are incidents
of the journey. When the wind blows and the rain
falls, the traveller draws his cloak closer round, presses
his hat on his head, and prepares to fight the storm.
Anon the storm leaves him, the sunshine breaks the
clouds, and warms his frozen limbs; the traveller
smiles and blesses God. But do rain or sunshine
change his journey's end?" The end was something
other far than happiness. Mazzini looked for a principle
that would rate the moral above the material,
altruism above selfishness, humanity above the individual;
something that would reconcile where Rights
divided, that would make men reach to an ideal, and
by it live and die for others. "We must find an
educative principle, to guide men to better things, to
teach them constancy in sacrifice, to bind them to
their brothers without making them dependant on any
one man's theory or on the brute force of the community.
This principle is Duty. We must convince
men that they, sons of one God, have here on earth to
carry out one law,&mdash;that each of us must live not to
himself but others,&mdash;that the end of life is not to have
more or less of happiness but to make ourselves and
others better,&mdash;that to fight injustice and error, everywhere,
for our brothers' good, is not a right only but
a duty,&mdash;duty we may not without sin neglect, duty
that lasts long as life." "Life is a mission," the call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
that comes to every man to make the ideal real.
"Life was given you by God, that you might use it
for the profit of Humanity; that you might so direct
your individual faculties, that they will develop your
brothers' faculties, that by your work you might add
something to the collective work of bettering men and
finding Truth." Life is a war with evil; "we cannot
root it out down here, but we can wage undying battle
with it, and everlastingly weaken its dominion." To
such God's Providence has called us. The divine plan
needs our conscious efforts to assist it, and the law,
that rules the Universe, becomes a positive binding law
of conduct. Man's bounden duty is everywhere and
in all things to forward the progress of humanity,
which is written in God's law. "The supreme virtue
is sacrifice,&mdash;to think, work, fight, suffer, where our lot
lies, not for ourselves but others, for the victory of
good over evil."</p>

<p>God demands the whole of man. Negative, inactive
goodness is nothing by itself. Our duty lies on earth,
among our fellow-men, in the busy, throbbing life
around us, not in some vain selfish search for spiritual
satisfaction. "Rest is immoral. There is here-down
and there ought to be no rest." Our business is to
make men and their surroundings better, not live for
ourselves in self-absorption or æsthetic ecstasy or
solitary thought and prayer. That is none other than
the search for happiness in subtle shape. "The earth
is our workshop; we may not curse it, we must hallow
it." "God has placed you here on earth; he has set
around you millions of beings like yourselves, whose
march keeps pace with yours, whose life finds sustenance
in your life. He willed to save you from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
perils of solitary existence, and therefore gave you
needs, which by yourselves you cannot satisfy,&mdash;mastering
social instincts, which are only latent in the
brute creation and which distinguish you from it. He
has placed this world around you,&mdash;this world, that
you call Matter, glorious in its beauty, teeming with
life, life, which, remember, everywhere displays God's
finger, but expects your work upon it and multiplies
its powers according as your activities are multiplied.
He has planted in you inextinguishable sympathies,
pity for them that mourn, joy for them that laugh,
wrath against the oppressors of God's creatures, the
importunate searching for the truth. And you," he is
addressing the pietists, "deny and despise those marks
of your mission that God has lavished round you, you
lay a curse upon his manifestations, when you bid us
concentrate our strength in a work of inward purification,&mdash;a
work imperfect and impossible to the man
who is alone." There is no virtue in the cloistered
life. There is "nothing worse than depression, nothing
more enervating than self-contemplation." "We are
here not to contemplate but to transform nature; and
self almost always lies at the bottom of contemplation.
The world is not a spectacle, it is a field of battle,
where all, who love the Just, the Holy, the Beautiful,
must bear their part, be they soldiers or generals, conquerors
or martyrs." "Do not analyse," he once
wrote; "do not light Psyche's lamp to examine and
anatomise life. Do good around you: preach what
you believe to be the truth and act accordingly; then
go through life, looking forward."</p>

<p>Nor will God's servants take thought for their own
salvation. "God will not ask us, 'What hast thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
done for thy own soul?' but 'What hast thou done
for the souls of others, the sister-souls I gave thee?'"
"We cannot rise to God save by our brothers' souls,
and we must make them better and more pure, even
though they ask us not." "When I hear men say,
'There is a just man,' I ask, 'How many souls are
saved by him?'" And again, the mere passive love
and apprehension of the truth are no fulfilling of God's
law. Even the preaching of truth avails not, unless
the preacher strive for it in his daily life. "Thought
and action," so he never wearied of insisting, must go
hand in hand. "What good are ideas," he asked,
"unless you incarnate them in deeds?" "It is not
enough that thought be grounded on truth; the
thinker's life must visibly express it in his acts; there
must be an ever living harmony between mind and
morals, between the idea and its application." "Every
thought, every desire of good, which we do not, come
what may, seek to translate into action, is a sin. God
thinks in working, and we must, at a distance, copy
him." The great men of earth, of whom Jesus was
the prototype, were those who wrought as well as
thought,&mdash;missionaries, politicians, martyrs, as well as
poets and philosophers;&mdash;such men as Aeschylus
and Dante, Pythagoras and Savonarola and Michelangelo,&mdash;most
of them, he loved to think, Italians.
The great nation was that, whose thought was fruitful
in great action, which to high ideals linked noble
deeds and taught its sons to work and die. "He who
sunders faith from works, thought from action, the
moral man from the practical or political man, is not
in truth religious. He breaks the chain that binds
earth and heaven."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore are we called to work, work without
ceasing and with all our power, putting behind us
fear and thought of self and looking for results or
praise of men; work all the more, when evil is strong
around us and the way of truth is dark; work, if need
be, even unto death. The law of sacrifice, which
Christ left us for our heritage, finds its highest, best expression
in martyrdom. "Life and death," he replied,
when attacked for sending young Italians to their
doom in insurrection, "are both sacred: two angels
of God, ministering alike to a higher end, the victory
of truth and justice." Men may do more by their
deaths than by their lives, and the memory of those,
who die in the service of their fellows, may inspire
generations and win a country's freedom. "It is not
enough to follow the instincts of the heart," he wrote
to an impulsive youth, "not enough to let the
enthusiasm of a good nature impel you to a good
deed now and again. This is the career of 'men of an
impulse,' who are one degree lower than 'men.' The
admiration of the Beautiful, the Great, the Divine, that
I ask of you, must be constant in every hour, in every
act." We may work from love, while it is given us;
but when love grows cold and enthusiasm fails and
the damp night of doubt and disappointment settles
down, "the simple knowledge of duty" must be
there, to bid us work and for ever work. "You must
do good," he told another, "for the sake of goodness
only." Nor may we ask to see our work's
results. Results will come to the race, if not to the
individual. Men may see little fruit of their labours;
the individual's struggles may end in vanity and
disappointment. But the race profits from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
seeming waste. The individual, who is left by himself
"face to face with infinity," loses courage, as he
complained that Carlyle did, and slides into "scepticism
and misanthropy." But he will not faint, if he
remembers that all Humanity is working to one
end; he will know that it is not success that matters,
but effort in the right direction. "God measures not
our strength but our intentions." "Where you cannot
have victory, salute and bless martyrdom. The angels
of Martyrdom and Victory are brothers, and both
spread their wings above the cradle of your future
life." "You may succeed or not," he wrote to a
parliamentary candidate;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> "that is not the vital
question. The question is to work manfully; to
stand on the ground of a principle, whilst almost
everybody makes life a thing of tactics and compromises."</p>

<p>But, when a man has listened to the call of God,
and purged his soul of self, and given himself to duty,&mdash;sober,
persistent, fearless duty,&mdash;his is the power
that nothing else can give. For duty "borrows from
the Divine nature a spark of its omnipotence." Men
will not die for rights; they will for duty. They will
not give up all that makes life pleasant, brave toil and
danger and opprobrium, for self-interest; they will do
it for a principle. Only a sense of duty makes a
people fight through all a generation for a freedom,
that only their children can enjoy. Therefore he,
who would rouse men to noble deeds, and lift them to
sacrifice and heroism, whether it be in the small things
of commonplace citizenship or in the fiery trial of a
revolution, must call them in the name of duty. Again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
he appealed to the great example. "Jesus sought not
to save a dying world by criticism. He did not speak
of interests to men whom the worship of interests
had poisoned with selfishness. He asserted in God's
holy name principles unknown before; and those few
principles, which we, eighteen centuries after, are still
seeking to translate into facts, changed the face of the
world. One spark of faith accomplished what all the
sophisms of philosophers had had no glimpse of,&mdash;a
step forward in the education of mankind."</p>

<p>Mazzini probably never asked himself what was the
ultimate sanction of his code; and, if he had been
pushed to it, it is not easy to surmise what answer he
would have given. He could hardly have found the
sanction in the positive commandment of the Deity,
for he held that the will of God was revealed only
through humanity, and this transfers the sanction to
another ground. Nor, even had he been familiar with
them, would he have based the principle on evolutionary
arguments,&mdash;that altruism is necessary to
the race, that that community will survive, which
contains the greatest number of self-sacrificing individuals.
He would have assented to the facts, but
he would probably have said that no theory of heredity
or race selection can explain the origin of altruism,
which is a personal, conscious, self-generated sense,
which therefore cannot come from any 'natural,'
unconscious source. Nor, again, would he have said,
as a Utilitarian might say, that the life of duty is the
highest form of happiness, that there is a sense in which
altruism and egoism are identical, because he most
tastes fruition, who loses himself in love and work for
other men. There is a truth in this, that Mazzini
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
neglected; he sometimes forgot that Christianity was
an Evangel, good tidings of great joy,&mdash;that, so long
as love and enthusiasm and the martyr's passion
possess a man, so far as he has attained to the glorious
liberty of the children of God, the life of duty is the
highest happiness. But he knew only too well that
gloom and depression will come, that, when the light
fails, duty becomes a stern taskmaster, and that no
principle of happiness (in any acceptation of the word)
will keep a man always faithful to his mission. And
so he would almost certainly have fallen back on the
conscience, as the ultimate moral sanction. "Life," he
says, "is a march onwards to Self, through collective
Perfecting to the progressive realisation of an Ideal."
Whether he had called it 'self-realisation' or any less
ambiguous name, he would have come to the position
that a man feels that he owes it to himself to strive
for the best he knows, to 'do his duty for duty's sake,'
that he must justify his thoughts and actions to himself&mdash;his
unsophisticated self,&mdash;that, if not, he will feel
remorse and guilt. The practical value of any system
of ethics depends on whether it appeals to 'the sanction
in the mind itself,' to feelings familiar to the mass
of would-be moral men. To such the direct appeal to
conscience has more weight than all the arguments of
theologians or utilitarians.</p>

<p class="p2">In his essay on <i>The Duties of Man</i> and elsewhere
Mazzini enumerates the various spheres of duty. A
man's duties begin with himself, not from any self-regarding
motive, but because as is a man's own
worthiness, so is his power to help his country or
mankind. Never was one more passionate for personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
holiness. 'Be good, be good,' is the recurring theme
that runs through all his writings and political aspirations.
"There is only one end, the <i>moral</i> progress of
man and humanity." "You must labour all your life,"
he wrote to a young Italian, "to make your own self
a temple to the Ideal, to God." "To draw near to
God, purifying our conscience as a temple, sacrificing
self for love,&mdash;this is our mission. To make ourselves
better,&mdash;this is the order of the day, which must be the
rule and consecration of our work." All his labours
for his country had the supreme end in view, that
Italian men and women should lead godly lives.
"Make yourselves better," he said to Italian working
men in words, that show how little of the demagogue
there was in him, "this must be the object of your
life. Preach virtue, sacrifice, and love to the classes
above you; and be yourselves virtuous and prepared
for sacrifice and love. You must educate and perfect
yourselves as well as educate and perfect others."</p>

<p>A man's next duties are to his family. Dear, very
dear, to him was the life of family, which he in his self-forgetfulness
had put aside. "The only pure joys,
unmixed with sadness, that it is given men to enjoy on
earth, are the joys of Family." Outside it "men may
find brief joys and comforts, but not the supreme comfort,
the calm as of a peaceful lake, the calm of trustful
sleep, the child's sleep on its mother's breast." The
family is an eternal element of human life, more
durable even than country; and the true man will
make his family the centre of his life, never wandering
from it, never neglecting it. True love is "tranquil,
resigned, humble," as Dante's love for Beatrice. The
wife will be the equal of her husband, she who is "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
reflex for the individual of the loving Providence that
watches over humanity." Mazzini repudiated any
artificial assimilating of the sexes; but their differing
functions were equally sacred and necessary. There
must be therefore no superiority of man over woman,
no inequality, domestic or political. A man must
make his wife his comrade, not only in his joys and
sorrows, but in his thoughts and work. He must love
his children with "a true, deep, severe love." "Before
Humanity and God children are the most awful
responsibility that a human being can have." "It
depends on us," so he quoted from Lamennais,
"whether our children turn out men or brutes."</p>

<p>But the family, that shuts itself within its own small
circle, betrays its God-appointed function. It was
made to be a school of service for humanity, and teach
men to be citizens. The <i>égoisme à deux</i>, that forgets
country and mankind, the "blind, nerveless, unreasoning
love of children, that is selfishness in the parents
and destruction for them," betray the family's glorious
prerogative. "Few mothers or fathers, in this irreligious
age of ours, and especially among the well-to-do classes,
understand the gravity and sacredness of their educational
duties." Terrible to their country are the fruits
of "the selfishness taught by weak mothers and careless
fathers, who let their children regard life not as a duty
and mission, but as a search for pleasure and a study of
their own well-being." The true parent will teach his
children not only to be good, but to be patriots, loving
their country, honouring its great men; will teach them
"not hatred of oppressors but an earnest looking forward
to fight oppression," will make them reverent to true
authority, but rebels against false. There is danger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
he says, in Goethe's maxim: 'do the duty that lies
nearest thee.' As him, so it may lead others into a
moral solitude, where the cry of humanity comes not.
It is so easy in happy life of family, in absorption in
one's special work, to forget the duties of a citizen, to
avoid the fret and stress, may-be the hardships and the
danger, of politics and social duty. But it is not enough
for men to be "kind towards their friends, affectionate
in their families, inoffensive towards the rest of the
world." The true man knows that he may not decline
responsibility for those, whom God has made his fellow-citizens.
And higher still, higher than family or
country, stands Humanity; and no man may do or
sanction aught for either, which will hurt the race.
Ever before Mazzini stood the vision of the cross,
Christ dying for all men, not from utilitarian calculation
of the greatest number, but because love embraces all.</p>

<h2>Chapter XV<br />
The State</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p class="s08 hanging">
The moral law and the state&mdash;Duties of the state: liberty, association,
education&mdash;Sovereignty is in God&mdash;Democracy&mdash;The ideal government&mdash;The
republic&mdash;The ideal state.
</p>

<p>In politics, as for the individual, the moral law, so
Mazzini taught, must reign supreme. "The end of
politics is to apply the moral law to the civil organisation
of a country." The state exists for the sake of
morality; its one and only final object is to help the
moral growth of the men and women within its
borders, help it through all the countless influences
that society exercises on the individual. Morality is
largely determined by environment; and the state
must so fashion the environment, that the moral life
may ever flourish more abundantly in it. "You cannot
found the brotherhood of Christ, where ignorance
and misery, servility and corruption on the one side
and culture, riches, power on the other prevent any
mutual esteem and love. Men will not understand
the virtue of sacrifice, where money is the sole foundation
of individual security and independence." How
can they train their children to true patriotism, when
a debased conception of it rules, and all around them
men and women are thinking of their private gain and
pleasure? How train them to perfect honesty, "when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
tyranny and espionage compel men to be false or
silent on two-thirds of their opinions?" How to despise
money, "where gold alone buys honours, influence,
respect, nay, is all that stands between them and
the caprice and insults of their masters?" "Take a
man, for instance," he says, writing in the worst days
of working-class depression, "who labours hard from
fourteen to sixteen hours a day to obtain the bare
necessities of existence; he eats his bacon and potatoes
(when indeed he can get them) in a place which might
rather be called a den than a house; and then, worn
out, lies down and sleeps; he is brutalised in a moral
and physical point of view; he has not ideas but propensities,&mdash;not
beliefs but instincts; he does not read,
he cannot read. How can you come at him, how
kindle the divine spark that is torpid in his soul, how
give the notion of life, of sacred life, to him, who
knows it only by the material labour that crushes
him and by the wages that abase him? How will
you give him more time and more energy to develop
his faculties except by lessening the number of hours
of labour and increasing his profits? How, above
all, will you raise his fallen soul and give him the
consciousness of his duties and his rights, except by
his initiation into citizenship&mdash;in other words, the
suffrage?" Some day it will be otherwise. "When
there is family life and property, education and
political function for all, when through them men
have closer communion with one another, then family
and property and country and humanity will become
more sacred to them all. When Christ's arms, still
stretched upon the martyr's cross, are freed to clasp
humanity in one embrace, when earth has no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
brahmins and pariahs, masters and servants, but only
<i>men</i>, then shall we worship with far other faith and
other love God's holy name."</p>

<p>There are, in the main, three ways, by which the
state can foster the moral life of the citizens. First
of all it must secure liberty; not that liberty is an end
in itself, but because it is the necessary condition of
morality. There can be no morality without responsibility,
no responsibility without liberty to choose
between good and evil, between social service and self-interest.
Liberty is necessary to true progress, for a
progress that is imposed from above and not freely
accepted by the people,&mdash;the whole programme of
paternal despotism,&mdash;works no change in character,
and therefore is "a soulless form," which cannot live.
Only the freeman, who owns no lord but God, can
attain to his full spiritual stature. "Where liberty is
not, life is reduced to a simple organic function. The
man, who allows his liberty to be violated, betrays his
own nature, and rebels against God's decrees." Thus
there are certain fundamental liberties, which not even
a democracy may legitimately infringe. "No majority,
no force of the community may take from you what
makes you men." These liberties include, save in rare
exceptions, "all that is indispensable to feed life morally
and materially,"&mdash;personal liberty, religious liberty, unqualified
liberty of speech and press, liberty of association,
liberty of trade,&mdash;all of them liberties, without
which men cannot choose their sphere of duty, without
which society is destined to waste or stagnation.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Mazzini omits not only
liberty of immoral action, however 'self-regarding,' but
any liberty that has an anti-social tendency. He did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
not admit, for instance, any absolute right of property,
and, as we shall see, limited the right of bequest, and
advocated severe taxation to check great inequalities
of fortune. Theoretically he believed that government
should possess very wide powers. But on the whole,
when we come to the details of his social programme,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
his position is the Liberal one; and (always excepting
education) he stood against any great extension of
state interference. It was not from any love of individualism
and free competition; he hated them as
anarchical,&mdash;fatal to spiritual unity and true citizenship,
fatal to the welfare of the masses. But he wished the
higher order to evolve, not from compulsion, which left
the moral sense untouched, not by the force of the
majority or of a despotism, but through a moral growth,
which carried the community willingly and consciously
towards a better state. The liberty to do good would
become through education the liberty of doing good.
This meant, as we shall see, that he allowed no liberty
in education, for moral education must be uniform and
therefore removed from individual choice. But this
encroachment on liberty once made for the sake
of a common morality, for the sake of that same
morality he desired liberty in most other spheres of
civil life.</p>

<p>But liberty is not enough. By itself, it is a mirage
for the masses of mankind. "What is liberty of trade
for the man without capital or credit? What are free
opportunities of education for him who has no time for
study?" Only Association can make liberty a reality
for the masses, or allow new elements of progress to
assert themselves, or save the waste that comes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
isolated or conflicting labours. Nay more, association
gives the sense of brotherhood, the spiritual strength,
that comes from sharing others' work, from merging
individual action in a bigger cause. "Association
multiplies your strength a hundred fold; it makes the
ideas and progress of other men your own; it raises,
betters, hallows your nature with the affections of the
human family and its growing sense of unity." As
Progress is the great intellectual discovery of the
modern world, so Association is its new-found instrument.
Thus association must be dear to the state as
individual liberty; and provided that any particular
association is peaceful and public, and respects
elementary liberties, and has no immoral end in view,
the state must allow it perfect freedom.</p>

<p>Thus the second duty of the state is to encourage
association and harmonise it with liberty; to give
society the originating power of the latter, the effective
strength of the former. Both are "equally necessary
to the end, which is progress," both "essential to the
orderly development of society." On any sound
theory, the two principles postulate one another.
There can be no association except among free men,
since true association implies a conscious recognition
and acceptance of the object. Liberty is meaningless
without association, because the individual, for all his
freedom, is powerless unless he combine with others.
Mazzini carefully dissociated himself alike from the
<i>laissez-faire</i> school and a despotic state socialism.
The state must encourage combination, but may do
nothing to compel it. The members of an association
must be unfettered as to its nature and object and
methods (always provided that they are legitimate),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
must be free to take up or resign their membership.
"Sacred to us is the individual; sacred is society.
We do not mean to destroy the former for the latter
and found a collective tyranny; nor do we mean to
admit the rights of the individual independently of
society, and consign ourselves to perpetual anarchy.
We want to balance the operations of liberty and
association in a noble harmony." "The republican
formula is 'everything in liberty through association.'"</p>

<p>Mazzini did not seriously concern himself with the
abstract relations of the individual and society; probably
it seemed to him a meaningless dispute. His theory
admitted no real antagonism between them. A man's
true individuality lies not in self-assertion but in the
recognition of his duty to his fellows. This recognition
necessarily makes friction impossible between himself
and them, and reconciles the individual and society,
liberty and association, in a common national aim.
Liberty then becomes the higher liberty, not the mere
power of refusing evil, but "the power of choosing
between the different ways that lead to good." Association
becomes the economical direction of the country's
forces to a known and common end. It is the function
of the state,&mdash;a function it alone can execute,&mdash;to instil
the sense of duty into all its members and make that
sense of duty work towards a common ideal. This it
must do through national education, and education
thus becomes the state's third and weightiest task. In
Mazzini's conception education goes far beyond the
imparting of knowledge or even the drawing out of
character. It is the inspiration of a national faith, the
moulding of the soul to great principles of life and
duty. It is, next to religion from which it derives, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
great binding and harmonising element in a nation,
merging individual wills in a common consensus, destroying
party friction and class struggle and sectarian
faction, and sweeping a united country onward to the
fulfilment of its destinies. If it had been objected that
the result would be destructive of independence and
originality of thought, he would probably have answered
that the same spirit does not prevent diversities of
operations, and that true originality is better promoted
by discipline than by license. Certainly, as his theory
of genius shows, he set a very high value on originality.
Let thought, he would have said, be free and wide as
air, but without community of aim it wastes itself, and
the state must prevent that waste. Thus there is no
true country without a national education, compulsory
and free. Voluntary education has its necessity under
a political or spiritual despotism, but it leads to moral
anarchy, and religious democracy cannot tolerate false
teaching of its children. The country must have "the
moral direction of the young." "It is ridiculous to
allow every citizen the right to teach his own programme,
and refuse the nation the right to transmit
its." Once, when discussing the matter with a friend,
the question was put to him, "If two states had arrived
at an equal stage of education, the one by national and
the other by voluntary schools, which would be the
finer nation?" "But, my dear," he answered, "that is
to be an atheist." The national education must therefore
express the national faith and aim, and give "the
moral unity, which is far more important than material
unity." It is not at all clear how he proposed to
ascertain this national faith. For England, he had a
curious proposal; "you ought," he said to Jowett, "to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
ascertain the mind of the people by making enquiries
of the clergy and others what they believed, and when
you have ascertained the national mind, you should
express it in education." In the future Italy he sometimes
thought that it would be embodied in a national
declaration of principles, drafted by a Constituent
Assembly. But more generally he seems to have
distrusted the capacity of the democracy to voice
the full faith, and he probably reserved it to the
spiritual power under the new religion to enunciate its
articles.</p>

<p>At all events national education implied above all
else moral education, the moral education which is as
"a holy communion with all our brothers, with all the
generations that lived, and therefore thought and wrought
before us."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This, he laments, "is anarchy now." If
it is left to the parents, it is often neglected or bad; if
to the teachers, clerical or lay, it too frequently instils
either superstition or materialism, or at all events it has
no uniformity. Mazzini intended to write a book on
education; if he had done so, we should know more
of the agencies, through which he proposed to give
moral teaching. Bakounine once asked him, what, if
he had got his republic, he would do to make the
people really free. Mazzini replied, "Establish schools,
in which the duties of man, sacrifice, and devotion would
be taught." He had a skeleton programme as a basis
of citizen training,&mdash;"a course of nationality, including
a summary picture of the progress of humanity, national
history, and a popular statement of the principles which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
rule the country's legislation"; but one cannot think
that this gave all he wanted. He probably counted
more on the universities, and especially on the courses
of philosophy; and this no doubt explains his strong
dislike of professors, whose teaching seemed to smack
of materialism, his indictment of the eclecticism, which
allowed different schools to be represented in the chairs.
He had a particular animus against German professors
and German philosophy. He blamed the appointment
of Germans at Oxford; he was very angry that Hegel
was taught at the university of Naples. "One fine
day," he wrote, "we will sweep out all that stuff."</p>

<p class="p2">What form of government was best calculated to
attain these ends,&mdash;to give full play to liberty, to harmonise
it with association, to supply a true national
education? No form, Mazzini replied, is right <i>per se</i>.
He held to the full, though probably not recognising
it, the scholastic doctrine of government by grace.
"Sovereignty is not in I nor we but God." "There is
no sovereignty of right in any one; sovereignty is in
the aim." A government was legitimate in proportion
as it stood for righteousness. "There is no sovereignty
in the individual or society, except in so far as either
conforms itself to the divine plan and law. An individual
is either the best interpreter of God's law and governs
in his name, or he is a usurper to be overthrown. The
simple vote of a majority does not constitute sovereignty,
if it evidently contradicts the supreme moral precepts
or deliberately shuts the road to progress." "The will
of the people is sacred, when it interprets and applies
the moral law; null and impotent, when it dissociates
itself from the law, and only represents caprice."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>The theory is of course, as in the days of the
schoolmen, a tremendous instrument for reform.
No institution, no branch of legislature, no church,
no prerogative or prescriptive claim has any rights
against the Right. Do they or not make for the
country's good? By the answer they must stand or
fall. The theory is supremely true, and on occasion
of highest social value. Its dangers lie in the possibility
of mistaken application, and in its tendency to
regard the form rather than the spirit of an institution,&mdash;a
danger especially present to minds like Mazzini's,
which are deficient in powers of accurate analysis. An
institution, so runs their reasoning, has failed; therefore
it is wrong; therefore it must be swept away. Reform
is impossible; therefore let there be root-and-branch
revolution. It is strange that Mazzini, with his
admiration of English habits and dislike of French,
did not see how here his logic approximated to the
latter. He did not see how plastic institutions are,
how it is often better to save the great expenditure of
force, that must go to destroy a rooted institution, how
it is sometimes easier to change the spirit than the
form. In this his political wisdom went astray, and
his long profitless crusade against the monarchy is a
melancholy illustration of the error.</p>

<p>Thus, then, there is no essential sovereignty in any
form of government. But democracy is the form
most likely to interpret God's law aright. We must
"reverence the people," not because they are the
majority, "but because they concentrate in themselves
all the faculties of human nature distributed among
the several individuals,&mdash;faculties of religion and
politics, industry and art." In other words, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
collective wisdom of the many is likely to excel the
wisdom of the few; a democratic state can use the
special knowledge of every citizen, and choose the
most capable for its administrators; and its judgment
is likely to be more four-sided and better informed than
that of a state with restricted citizenship. And just
as Humanity is the interpreter of God's law, so a
people often has an inspiration that seldom comes to
individuals, glimpses of the truth that are granted
to the multitude in moments of enthusiasm, an
instinct that impels it to give power to its best men.
He even, inconsistently with his general position,
justifies democracy on <i>à priori</i> grounds; it is "a
potent, undeniable, European fact," and therefore
must be a part of God's providential design.</p>

<p>But it is impossible not to feel that all through
Mazzini's thought there runs a certain uneasiness
about democracy. He accepted it as an inevitable
fact; he recognised that at all events it was superior
to any government based on privilege; it fitted in
with his theory of Humanity and his own passionate
sympathies. But he had an intermittent dread that
democracy, like theocracy and monarchy, might forget
the law of God. He feared that the French Revolution
had started it on the wrong road; he had had
his disappointments in Italy; in later life he felt the
peril that materialist socialism might deflect it from
spiritual ends. He advocated universal suffrage, not
because of any absolute virtue in it, but as "the
starting-point of political education," and he gravely
feared that, till national education had created a
national consensus, it might easily become a tyranny
of the majority. He preferred a system of indirect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
election. Towards the end of his life he was a keen
advocate of women's suffrage, but he was anxious that
the agitation for it should be equally an agitation for
their own moral growth, a crusade against "their
perennial vanity, their worship of ridiculous fashions,
their lightness of parties and conversation," their
husband-hunting. And this mistrust made him turn
to a strong authority, elected and deposable by the
people, but with very extended powers, and charged
not only to execute the popular mandate, but go in
advance of it. "The supreme power in a state must
not drag behind the stage of civilisation that informs
it; it must rather take the lead in carrying it higher,
and, by anticipating the social thought, bring the
country up to its own level." It is for republics to
make republicans, not republicans republics. He
earnestly repudiated the Whig-American theory of
government. Anxiously as he guarded personal and
religious and commercial liberty, he wished to see the
functions of government, at all events in education
and as a stimulating and suggestive influence, as wide
and not as narrow as possible. Distrust of government
in itself, the whole system of checks and balances, he
condemned as weakening the power of the state to
promote progress. It is extremely difficult to disentangle
with precision what was his ideal constitution,
and it may be doubted whether he had worked it out
himself. Though he probably had no very strong
liking for parliamentary government, he seems to have
accepted it, and to have wished to give it large
executive powers. But above it, and apparently distinct
from the executive, was to be the real "government,"
the spiritual authority, whose duty it would be to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
"point to the national ideal," while parliament and
the executive "directed the forces of the country" in
the road it indicated. But there must be no suspicion
of dictatorship, and perfect trust and mutual inspiration
must unite the spiritual and temporal authorities.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>At all events the ideal government, whatever its
precise form, could, he believed, exist only under a
republic. The story of his life has shown how passionately
he clung to his republican faith; how for it he
gave or wasted his best days, how his untamable
desire for it tangled his work for Italian Unity. His
condemnation of monarchy was partly a theoretical
one. The republic was "the most logical form of
democracy," the only corollary of liberty and equality;
monarchy was founded on inequality, its dynastic
interests were not the nation's, and therefore it could
never give a country moral unity. Whether absolutist
or constitutional, it was a sham, because in modern
life it corresponded to no real belief, no essential
principle; and because it was a sham, it was the fruitful
parent of dishonesty. Quite late in life he somewhat
changed his point of attack, and condemned it as
possessing no vitality to lead, and therefore impotent
to found a strong government. But his indictment, at
least in his early years, was drawn mainly from the
actual evidence of corruption and misrule in the
monarchies of the first half of the century. It
may well have seemed impossible then to reconcile
monarchy with any national well-being. He made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
little or no exception for constitutional monarchies.
Louis Philippe's rule was small argument for the
principle; and as late as 1862 he condemned constitutional
monarchy as "incompatible with progress,"
everywhere outside England. For England, in later
years, he made an exception; and his judgment here
shows that he could view the issue more serenely,
when he escaped from his prejudices. "The struggle,
which occupies English life," he said in 1870, "is not
between the nation and the monarchy, but between
the people and the aristocracy, the latter being the
one element of the past, that retains and communicates
its vitality." In Italy the facts were after 1848
much the same as in England; but here he was
blinded by party feeling, and he could never see that
what was the real issue in the thirties had gone
into the background. His fallacy was a nominalist one.
In his early days there had been a vital difference between
monarchy and republic. Afterwards the classification
became unreal; and the true differentiation
lay in various species of parliamentary government, in
various relations between parliament and the executive.
In his own Italy to-day the republic becomes increasingly
a factitious and academic issue, as more
vital questions make the true dividing lines in politics.</p>

<p>However mistaken his distinction between republic
and monarchy, the republic, as he conceived it, was no
mere form of government. "God is my witness," he said,
"that I pay no tribute to forms." He had little liking
for the republic in the United States, with its weak bond
of union, and its system of checks and balances. He
refused his blessing to the Third Republic in France.
"By the Republic," he told the Roman Assembly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
1849, "we do not mean a mere form of government,
a name, a system imposed by a victorious party on
its rivals. We mean a principle, a new step forward
in education taken by the people, a programme of
education to be carried out, a political institution
calculated to produce a moral advance; we mean the
system which must develop liberty, equality, association;&mdash;liberty,
and consequently every peaceful development
of ideas, even when they differ in part from
our own;&mdash;equality, and therefore we cannot allow
political castes to be substituted for the old castes that
have passed away; association, that is a complete
consensus of all the vital forces of the nation, a
complete consensus, so far as is possible, of the entire
people." For him the republic meant absolute trust
between people and government, choice of the most
capable and best for office, a veritable national unity,
that destroyed party friction and impelled the undivided
forces of the country to social legislation.
The republic, and it alone, will be the ideal state,
God's kingdom realised on earth, "where institutions
tend primarily to the bettering of the most numerous
and poorest class, where the principle of association is
best developed, where the road of progress has no end,
as education gradually develops and all elements that
make for stagnation and immobility disappear, where,
in fine, the whole community, strong, tranquil, happy,
peaceful, bound in a solemn concord, stands on earth
as in a temple built to virtue and liberty, to progressive
civilisation, to the laws that govern the moral world."
There, in the people "that knows no caste or privilege,
save of genius and virtue, no proletariat or aristocracy
of land or finance," in the people "united by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
brotherhood of one sole faith, one sole tradition, one
sole thought of love," the people that worships principles
more than men, that cherishes its past but looks
ever forward to its future, resolute to unlock its
destinies,&mdash;there stands the city of God, "the similitude
of that divine society, where all are equal, and there is
one love, one happiness for all."</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI<br />
Social Theories</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p class="s08 hanging">
Importance of social questions&mdash;Their moral basis&mdash;Attack on socialism&mdash;Contrast
between Mazzini's and its theories and work&mdash;Social
programme&mdash;Cooperation.
</p>

<p>Mazzini's faith in the republic came largely of his
conviction that it was the only effective instrument
for social legislation. He was sometimes charged
with neglecting social for political reform, with preaching,
as Bakounine put it, a "detestable bourgeois
patriotism." The charge was true for no time of his
life, least for his later years. To him the social
question was "the most sacred" as it was "the most
hazardous" problem of the age. He was one of the
first to insist that the rise of the working classes was
the great social phenomenon of the century. Political
reform, so he told the Carbonari and the Chartists, had
its only sufficiency and justification, when it was the
instrument of social reform. This did not quite
represent his thought, for he was insistent that
questions of political liberty and justice intimately
touched man's moral development; but he held with
equal earnestness that the social question had its
independent and undying importance. "There is no
such thing," he wrote, "as a purely political or purely
social revolution; every true revolution has its political
and social character alike."</p>

<p>All his passionate sympathy went out to the
disinherited. Compassion, says one who knew him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
shone in his face and vibrated in his voice, when
he spoke of the masses and their hardships. He
felt intensely for a lot, which in the '40s and
'50s he believed was growing steadily worse. Indignantly
he spoke of the workman's "poverty-stricken,
cribbed, precarious life, closing in infirm and squalid
and unassisted old age." "The workman has no
freedom of contract," he replied to the old economists,
"he is a slave; he has no alternative but hunger or
the pay, however small it be, that his employer offers
him. And his pay is a <i>wage</i>; a wage often insufficient
for his daily needs, almost always unequal to
the value of his work. His hands can multiply the
employer's capital three fold, four fold, but not so his
own pay. Hence his incapacity to save; hence the
unrelieved, irreparable misery of commercial crises."
And even without crises, "his life is poisoned by a
sense of uncertainty and constant dread; and old age,&mdash;brought
on prematurely by heavy and often unhealthy
work,&mdash;awaits him, threatening, implacable."
His "destiny is that of accursed races,&mdash;to live and
suffer, curse and die." "A life of poverty and a death-bed
in a hospital,&mdash;that is what society in this nineteenth
century provides for two-thirds of its members
in almost every country, eighteen hundred years and
more since a Holy One, that men hail as divine,
proclaimed that all are equals and brothers and sons
of God."</p>

<p>But he was no pessimist, at all events in later years,
when he knew the workman better, and saw that, in
spite of all, he was advancing and gave promise of
infinite further advance. The day of deliverance was
near. The workman's emancipation was inevitable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
written in the decrees of Providence. The labour
question was the acknowledged problem of the time,
its solution "the social faith of all men now who love
and know." "The upward movement of the artisan
classes in our towns," he wrote towards the end of life,
"dates back now for more than a century; slow but
tenacious in its progress, advancing from decade to
decade by a law of increasing momentum, and in these
last twenty years growing, visibly for all, in intensity
and expansion, and acquiring, as it goes, real power
and self-consciousness." It all was "leading up to a
great revolution, an impulse given by Providence,
nevermore to recede, till it has reached its end." And
he gloried in it. Whatever fears he may have had for
the working of democracy, he had none for the labour
movement. The rise of the working classes was "as
a flowing tide, that the divine breath has stirred"; and
he watched it "not with fear, but with the loving
reverence, with which one watches a great providential
fact."</p>

<p>But just because his faith and love were great, he was
not afraid to point "the men of labour" to the heights.
It was his familiar precept of the moral aim. "Material
improvements," he told them, "are essential, and we
will fight to win them; not because men have no other
interest than to be well housed and clothed, but because
your moral development is stopped, while you
are, as you are to-day, engaged in a continual fight
with poverty." So too in his rather scanty references
to political economy, he insists that its teaching must
always have reference to a moral ideal. Economics
must be "the expression not of the human appetite
but of man's industrial mission." Otherwise, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
"substitute the problem of humanity's kitchen for
the problem of humanity," and teach selfishness for
individuals and classes and industrial warfare. It
was not only that economic progress must aim consistently
at personal morality, at making better
husbands, fathers, neighbours, that it must be pure of
any spirit of bitterness or revenge or aught that sins
against the brotherhood of man. Besides all this, it
must not be allowed to maim the working man's
powers and duties as a citizen, must never be purchased
by the sacrifice of political liberty or manliness.
He pointed for his moral to France in 1849 and
1850, when the French artisans sold their political
rights to Louis Napoleon for the promise of a labour
policy. 'Bread and amusements,' he reminded them,
were ever the offer of despots. Outside liberty and
strenuous political interest there was no salvation,
economic or other. The true man will think not only
of his class but of his country, and not of his own
country only, but of the sufferings and rights of men
the whole world over. If the working classes forgot
their political duties, thought lightly of political
reform, connived at an unjust foreign policy, they
sacrificed one of their nature's noblest functions, and
built their own economic progress on the sand. And
he believed that, France notwithstanding, the people
always knew this in their hearts. The Chartists, he
pointed out, with their bare, imperfect political programme,
had more followers than all the French
Socialists. "The last of those you call political
agitators," he told the latter, "will always have more
influence with the people than all your utopias; because
at the root of every political question the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
has at least a glimpse of something that appeals to its
soul, something that gives it self-consciousness and raises
its trampled dignity." "The working men of Italy
fought like heroes at Milan and Brescia, in Sicily and
at Rome, not for a rise of wages, but for the honour of
the Italian name, for the free life of their nation. The
working men of Paris fought and won in 1848, not
because of a financial crisis or their own poverty, but
because the monarchy dragged France's glory and
duty in the mud, because it refused French citizens a
free press, and free right of meeting and association."</p>

<p>It was from this standpoint that he attacked Socialism.
We need not concern ourselves with his strictures
on the expired schools of the early French Socialists,
or with his very crude criticism of Louis Blanc,&mdash;criticism,
which he would hardly have made in later
life, and which is certainly inconsistent with his own
social schemes. We can neglect, too, much of his
attack on the economic side of collectivism, which he
never really understood. It is more to the point to
assume a greater knowledge of modern Socialism than
he possessed, and see what is his essential relationship
to it. He had not a few ideas in common with the
Marxite school. His own industrial ideal contained,
though he knew it not, the germs of the socialist
community. He looked as earnestly and confidently
as they do to the death of capitalism, and built his
hopes on the development of association; he recognised
with them the inevitable historic evolution of the
workers, and that it is the march of the humble,
unknown multitude, and not the hero, which determines
the world's progress; he hailed the time, when
classes would be no more, and all be equals in rights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
and opportunities, and he believed that this equality
could never be reached under a capitalist system.</p>

<p>But in root principles he differed from the strict
Marxites almost as essentially as he himself supposed.
While with him moral and spiritual phenomena are the
fundamental facts, Marx builds his system on material
phenomena. For the collectivist, man is chiefly the product
of his economic surroundings; for Mazzini, the
social and industrial environment is only "the manifestation
of the moral and intellectual condition of humanity
at a given period, and above all of its faith." For the
one, history is the sequence of economic cause and effect,
and the growth of mind and morals is the secondary
consequence of economic facts; with the other, the
economic facts, though not neglected, are subordinated,
religion is the master principle of human progress, and
religious systems are the milestones that mark the
road. The two schools are absolutely antagonistic in
their conception of the ideal. Marx and his followers
would discover it by the right interpretation of the
drift of facts; if indeed we can call it an ideal, what is
accepted merely as a necessary tendency, and when
right and wrong are judged by the fact, not the fact
by right and wrong. Mazzini understood to the full
the value of facts as conditioning the ideal, as pointing
out how far it was attainable at the moment, nay, as in
some degree indicating the ideal itself. But to him
right and wrong had no dependance on the existing
fact; facts tended to approximate to the ideal, because
the ideal was sovereign, and Providence guided them
towards it; and it was man's free privilege and
bounden duty to help the work of Providence, and be
lord of facts. Mazzini did not kick against the pricks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of economic evolution; he took modern industrialism
as it is, and never wished to thwart the natural
tendencies of industrial discovery. But he claimed
that man has power to turn them to good or evil,&mdash;a
good or evil that has reference not to them but to a
moral end.</p>

<p>Hence their teaching has differed widely in its
practical consequences. Marx deduced from his
economic studies a confident and detailed prophecy
of economic development. It was a faith, whose
assurance and optimism gives it a mighty power
to sway men, so long as faith stays unquestioned.
But economic dogmas, especially of the prophetic
kind, are apt to be shaken by the rough wind of facts;
and it has been the fate of Marx' system to be line
by line explained away by its commentators. If it
still retains its influence,&mdash;and, indeed, it is a potent
influence,&mdash;it is because it has quieted scepticism by
shedding much of its founder's doctrine, and because
it finds and has more or less always found expression
in a political programme, such as Mazzini preached,
aiming at high ends of liberty and justice. Mazzini,
so confident often in his religious and political horoscopes,
here chose a humbler part. He insisted indeed
on one broad economic principle,&mdash;association, and he
pointed to certain reforms of immediate practicability.
But he resolutely refused to forecast the economic
future. Humanity, he would repeat, goes on its own
way, and laughs at the man, who finds "the secret of
the world under his pillow." "I think," he wrote,
"that our problem is not so much to define the forms
of future progress, as to place the individual under
such conditions as make it easy for him to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
and fulfil it." He created no great party of the
proletariat; it was his as useful function to fertilise
the moral soil, to inspire all classes with a deeper
sense of social obligation, and thus to ease the road
for social progress, whatever particular shape the
circumstances of the time might counsel it to take.</p>

<p>The two men differ again radically in their influence
on class relations. To Mazzini 'the struggle of
classes,' however peaceful and legal in its form, would
have been a hateful idea. It is true he sternly rebuked
the short-sighted folly of the richer classes, and he
would find excuses for wild acts or theories of proletariat
protest. But he set his face resolutely against
class hatred, against dreams of violence and revenge,
against social revolutions which worked hardship to
the individual. Hopeless as he was of enlisting the
upper classes, at least in Italy, on the side of social
reform, he set his hopes on the middle classes; and
from the days of the <i>Apostolato Popolare</i> down to the
last years of life, he preached insistently that middle
and working classes must stand together in the social
movement. The whole theory of Duty looked to the
harmonising of motives, not to the brute struggle of
opposing social forces. The collectivist takes the
social discord for granted, and bids the workers trust
to themselves alone and win their ends by force, however
much force may be disguised behind the vote.
Each principle has its time; the socialist mistake has
been to elevate to a principle, what is the sad necessity
of an uninspired age.</p>

<p class="p2">It remains to examine Mazzini's own programme of
social reconstruction. He lays down certain economic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
axioms. First, private property must remain, however
much the State should try to equalise fortunes through
taxation. Mazzini endorses the familiar argument
from expediency,&mdash;the necessity of property to
stimulate labour and encourage invention. But his
apology for it is in the main an <i>à priori</i> one. "Property,"
he says, "when it is the result of labour,
represents the activity of the body, as thought represents
the activity of the soul; it is the visible sign of
our part in the transformation of the material world,
as our ideas and our rights to liberty and inviolability
of conscience are the signs of our part in the transformation
of the moral world. The man who works
and produces has a right to the fruits of his own
labour; in this resides the right of property."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> There
is a flavour of Ricardo and Marx in this, and it is easy
to see a socialist application, unintended by the writer.
Next, the new social organisation must not be the
work of compulsion. He saw that voluntary working-class
organisation was an essential preliminary to any
lasting social advance; and, as we shall see, his own
schemes pivot on voluntary societies for cooperative
production. And lastly, schemes of economic change
must always aim at increasing productiveness. He
knew that there could be no serious improvement in
the workman's condition, unless the national production
were increased; and he seems to have dimly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
realised that the two things must mutually react, any
rise in the workman's income increasing the demand
for commodities and thereby stimulating production,
and this increase of production in its turn encouraging
a further increase of the workman's pay.</p>

<p>When we come to the particulars of his economic
programme, we find fertility and boldness of suggestion,
but small attempt to work out the details. He
was constitutionally unfitted to be an economist; he
lacked the necessary precision of thought and accuracy
of analysis. He rather despised economic study, at
all events when it came from books. A real knowledge
of the economic question is to be found, he says,
"in the workshops and the homes of the artisans,"
rather than in "statistics and documents, which are
sometimes erroneous, always incomplete, compiled as
they are either by officials, whose tendency is to
conceal the evil, or by private individuals, whose
tendency is to exaggerate it." He trusted to a knowledge
of the workman's thoughts and aspirations,
gleaned from close and affectionate intercourse, more
than to any inquiry into the outside facts of his
life.</p>

<p>His suggestions were many. Among the more
commonplace were free trade in land, legislation to
protect tenants, arbitration between capital and labour,
national insurance (apparently to be compulsory), the
regulation by the state of "that den of robbers," the
Stock Exchange. At one time he wished the state to
guarantee work for everybody, but as he does not
mention the proposal later than 1849, it may be
assumed that he relinquished it. For Italy, he suggested
a great scheme of home colonisation on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
unreclaimed lands; and it is a curious instance of his
want of accurate enquiry, that in his advocacy of it he
took no account of the all-important factor of malaria.
It is curious, too, that, like many Italians at the
opposite pole of thought, he disliked emigration, and
would gladly have checked what has proved to be one
of the chief sources of Italian development. All these,
however, were minor suggestions. His programme
rested mainly on two proposals,&mdash;a radical reform
of taxation, and the gradual supersession of capitalism
by voluntary cooperative societies of workmen. His
canons of taxation are shortly stated and may be
shortly summarised. Economy in collection, free
trade, no taxes on food, the smallest possible incidence
on industry were his fiscal maxims; and he
wished to carry them out by abolishing all indirect
taxation and, apparently too, all special taxes on
land, and substituting a single tax on income, to
be graduated and, it would seem, severely graduated.
He also proposed that in all cases of persons dying
without heirs within the fourth degree, estates should
lapse to the state.</p>

<p>He looked for more radical change to his scheme
of cooperative production, a scheme which appears
in its main outlines as early as 1833, but which he
worked out in more detail in the last ten years
of his life. It was a special application of the same
principle of Association, which he had carried into
other branches of social and political activity. He
proposed that a great national capital should be
accumulated for the purpose. Church lands, railways,
mines, and "some great industrial enterprises," which
he never specified, were to be nationalised, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
or not with compensation does not appear. At one
time he wished to confiscate in Italy the estates of
those, who fought against the nationalist cause,&mdash;a
proposal strangely out of harmony with his usual
tolerance. The income from these sources, from
the rents of reclaimed lands and existing national
and communal estates, and from properties which
lapsed to the state, would form the "National Fund"
or "tax of democracy." At one time he destined
part of the fund to education, another part to assist
any European democracy struggling for its rights.
But its main, and perhaps in his later idea its only
purpose was to assist the spread of voluntary societies
for cooperative production, industrial and agricultural.
Any such society, that could prove its members'
honesty and capacity, might claim to have its capital
advanced from the Fund. The loans were to be at
1 or 1½ per cent., and were to be made through
special banks administered by the Communal Councils.
Nothing is said as to the repayment of the loans, but
as he contemplated the extension of the societies, till
they ultimately covered the whole field of industry, we
may assume that the loans were to be repaid and passed
on to new societies. The societies were apparently to
be left absolutely free as to the management of their
business, the sale of produce, and the disposal of their
net income. To assist their credit, they were to have
the right to deposit any unsold produce in national
magazines, and receive in exchange negotiable notes,
which, it seems to follow, would have been legal
tender. The societies were also to be admitted on
equal terms with private firms to contract for government
work; this latter was perhaps the first suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
of a system, which is now working in Italy with some
success.</p>

<p>Such were Mazzini's sketchy but suggestive economic
schemes,&mdash;schemes which, he believed, would ultimately
destroy both poverty and capitalism, without hardship
to individuals or danger to liberty, leavening the social
morality with the God-given principle of association.
He seems to have never asked himself what would be
the ultimate destiny of his co-operative scheme; had
he done so, he must have seen that, by however
different a road, it was bound to end in collectivism.
It will be recognized now that his plan was in all
essentials identical with latter-day socialism, as put
out by its best exponents, and it may be claimed that
in the world of ideas Mazzini more than Marx is its
father. That his scheme would soon come into working,
he had little doubt, at all events in Italy. For in
his social plans, as in all else, his own Italy was ever
uppermost in mind. He knew, when few others knew
it, the patience and common-sense and idealism of the
Italian artisan, and he proudly counted on him to let
Italy lead the nations in the solution of the labour
question.</p>

</p>

<p>The law of Duty, man's bounden service to humanity,
goes on beyond the individual and the state to be
the rule of international relations. Man's end, so runs
Mazzini's argument, is to serve the progress of
humanity. But the individual, in his isolated impotence,
would shrink from the immensity of the
burden. And for most men, humanity excites no
effective sense of obligation; they will give for
country what they will not give for the wider and
remoter circle of mankind. The cosmopolitan, who
talks of duty to humanity and neglects the nation,
is as one who bids men climb a ladder and takes
away the rungs. Therefore Providence, once again
applying the law of association, has placed the
individual among men of like feelings and aspirations,
that serving his country he may serve humanity,
that through the nation and its common strength
he may have power to help the progress of the world.
Thus a nation is a God-appointed instrument for
the welfare of the race, and in this alone its moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
essence lies. "Nationality is sacred to me," he says,
"because I see in it the instrument of labour for
the good and progress of all men." "Countries are
the workshops of humanity"; "a nation is a living
task, her life is not her own, but a force and
a function in the universal Providential scheme."
"Humanity is a great army, marching to the conquest
of unknown lands, against enemies both strong
and cunning. The peoples are its corps, each with
its special operation to carry out, and the common
victory depends on the exactness, with which they
execute the different operations."</p>

<p>This "division of European labour" is essential to
the progress of Europe, and, through it, of the world.
But each group of humanity's workmen, if it is to
be efficient, must be organised, not by coercion, but
by free acceptance of their obligations; they must
be impelled by duty and the sense of a great
common work to do. Each nation must be a living,
homogeneous entity, with its own faith and consciousness
of self. Europe, in Mazzini's lifetime, had little
of this. He condemned its existing divisions as
answering to no principle, since for the most part
they were agglomerations of territory, made in the
interests of a royal dynasty or in the name of some
artificial principle, as the balance of power; and therefore
they were powerless to inspire a common national
effort for an intelligent and useful end. Factitious
and immoral ends filled up the void; unsatisfied
national yearnings burst imperiously through diplomatic
schemes of peace; there was little of the
burning love of independence, that alone safeguarded
from designs of aggressive empire, from France in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the past, from Russia in the present. The map of
Europe must be drawn afresh, and states be made
conterminous with nationalities.</p>

<p>What, then, are the inherent, essential marks of
nationality? Are race and geographical features,
language and literature, customs and traditions?
None of these, Mazzini replied, are more than
secondary elements, race least of all. Wiser and
juster than Bismarck and his school, he saw that
race, even if it were discoverable, has small connection
with the facts of to-day. He did not investigate the
dark problem of race characteristics, he did not even
ask whether race affinities are among the physical
causes that create a national feeling. But, none the
less, his argument is indestructible against the theory
that makes race the chief base of nationality. He
was saved from ethnological fancies by his sensible
conclusion, that races are too intimately compounded
to be a cause of national character. "There is not
a single spot in Europe," he declared, "where an
unmixed race can be detected." "France, the most
powerful nationality of the modern world, is a mixture
of Germans, Celts, and Romans." There is one aspect
however of the race question, that he did not sufficiently
recognise. However imaginary the original
ethnological basis of a country may be and generally
is, yet some races have been fixed for several centuries;
and this has generated a belief in a common racial
origin, which, however false historically, may none the
less, when supported by a common language, become
an important and sometimes a dominant factor in
creating a sense of nationality.</p>

<p>He gave his fancy play in determining the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of geography. He loved geographical study,
and as usual sought for a spiritual purpose underlying
the physical facts. "By the courses of the great
rivers, by the lines of the high mountains, and other
geographical features God has marked the natural
borders of the nations." "Nationalities," he said,
"appear to me to have been traced long ago by the
finger of Providence on the map of Europe"; and
Italy, for instance, had her "sublime, irrefutable
boundary marks." He left this transcendentalism for
safer ground, when he came to language and literature,
and recognised what potent factors they had been in
the making of nations. The importance of language
was sufficiently obvious. Literature had sometimes,
as in the case of his own Italy, remained the one
surviving sign of nationality, when all else was lost.
He knew how great had been the influence of Dante
in forming the national sense of his own country;
how much the Polish poets of the century had done
to feed the Slav national spirit; how intimate is the
power of national melodies; what the common possession
of a great poet may do to knit a people. He
realised too, though perhaps insufficiently, how history
has helped to form nations; how a common government
draws a people together in common loyalty or
common revolt; how war may be a welding influence;
how men, living for generations under the same law,
acquire from it common habits and customs and
traditions.</p>

<p>All these, however, are but the formative elements
of nationality; they are not its essence. Mazzini's
clear democratic faith kept him from confusing the
justification of the fact with its causes. Nationality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
was independent of any of them. Centuries of divided
government had not destroyed the national sense of
Italy; Switzerland was a nation for all its diversity
of languages; difference of tongues did not prevent
Poland and Lithuania from sharing the same national
aspirations; Alsace belonged to France, however
German it might be by race and history. Nationality
is a sentiment, a moral phenomenon, which may be
generated by material causes, but exists by virtue of
moral facts. On any theory of freedom or democracy
it can have no positive, meaning basis but the popular
will; and it is a parody of nationality that unites by
coercion. "Nationalities can be founded only for and
upon and by the people"; and it follows that when the
inhabitants of a territory desire to be a nation, provided
that behind their desire there lies a moral
purpose, they have the right to be one. This, despite
slight and rare inconsistencies, he made the broad clear
principle of modern, democratic nationality, a principle
"invincible as conscience," whose triumph no hostility
of kings or statesmen, no artificial counterfeits can
permanently hinder.</p>

<p>Still, he held, the mere fact of the popular will is
not enough. Nationality, like every political phenomenon,
must have a moral aim to justify it. A
mere momentary reaction against misgovernment, for
instance, gave no sufficient claim to independence.
"In questions of nationality, as in every other question,
the end alone is sovereign"; and a true nation must
have its moral intention, its clear and understood
mission to accomplish for itself and for humanity, its
conscious part in realising the divine idea on earth.
It is only in its homage to the moral law, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
nation finds its "baptism and consecration." "A
community of men drawn together by a selfish principle
for a purely material purpose is not thereby a
nation. To constitute a nation, its informing principle
and purpose and right must be grounded on eternal
bases. The purpose must be essentially a moral one,
since a material interest by itself is by its nature finite,
and can therefore form no basis of perpetual union."
"Country is not a territory; territory is only its
base; country is the idea that rises on that base,
the thought of love that draws together all the sons
of that territory."</p>

<p>This love is patriotism. "O my brothers," he says,
"love your country. Country is our house, the house
that God has given us, setting therein a populous
family, to love us and be loved by us, to understand
us and be understood by us better and more readily
than others are." It was by such burning patriotism
he saved his country and was first to practise it
himself. But he detested the sentimental and emotional
patriot. His patriotism was a silent, manly thing,
that hated display and braggart talk; it was as a
steady spiritual flame, that never roared to heaven and
never sank to ashes. He tested it by its fruit in the
individual life. No ill-living man was true patriot.
"Let country," he said, "be incarnated in each one of
you; each one of you feel and make himself responsible
for his brothers; each of you so act that in yourselves
men may respect and love your country." "Where the
citizen does not know that he must give lustre to his
country, not borrow lustre from it, that country may
be strong but never happy." Real patriotism will not
fear to speak the truth. "Flattery will never save a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
country, nor proud words make us less abject." "The
honour of a country depends much more on removing
its faults than on boasting of its qualities." One can
imagine what would have been his scorn for the
degenerate imperialism of latter days. The patriot's
supreme desire is that his country's true honour may
be untarnished; he thinks more of duty than of
victory. His own Roman Republic, that glorious and
illuminating example of patriotism, had small hope of
success, but its honour stood entire, and therefore
morally it triumphed. Success, empire, military glory
may be a country's lot; so may failure and defeat
and poverty; neither this nor that fate touches its
real being. True national dignity and glory lie in
right doing, and humiliation comes only from public
dishonour and a mendacious diplomacy. "You must
keep your country pure of selfishness," was his maxim
of patriotism for Italian working men.</p>

<p>Patriotism, then, is intense regard for a country's
moral greatness; and it expresses itself in that sense
of national duty, which he held to be the only justification
of a country's national existence. This duty has
two objects, the community itself and all humanity.
We have seen what he conceived to be a nation's duty
to its members; there is no true country, he said,
without a national education, or where men starve for
want of work. Here we are more concerned with that
forwardness to serve humanity, which he made the
other mark of the true nation. "National life and
international life should be two manifestations of the
same principle, the love of good." Above the separate
nations stands the European brotherhood, the late-born
child of Christianity. Sir Thomas More, he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
first formulated the new law of peace; literature and
trade and travel are ever drawing the nations together
by "a law of moral gravitation"<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; the French Revolution
echoed through the democracies of Europe; the
struggle with Napoleon renewed the common understanding
of the nations. The cause of the people is
the same the whole world over, and the democracies
must join hands to fight the battle of them all, as he
had tried to make them do, when he founded Young
Europe. Humanitarian movements,&mdash;the abolition of
the slave trade, the cause of Greece and Italy,&mdash;were
European. "There exists then in Europe a harmony
of needs and wishes, a common thought, a universal
mind, which directs the nations by convergent paths
to the same goal." No country may be isolated,
economically or intellectually; and it is a poor and
counterfeit patriotism, that despises other countries.
That way lies destruction. "A nation's growth depends
on the trust that other peoples place in it";
a country guided by a moral principle "finds everything
open readily to it from markets to political
alliances," but one that stands for an unjust policy has
mistrust and jealousy for its portion.</p>

<p>Hence the country, that does injury to another, sins
against itself. "I hate," he said, "the monopolist,
usurping nation, that sees its own strength and greatness
only in the weakness and poverty of others."
That is a poor and stunted people, whose foreign
policy is "one of aggrandisement and selfishness,
whether it seeks them basely or buys glory at other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
men's expense." Countries, that cherish liberty at
home and outrage it abroad, "are fated to expiate
their error through long years of isolation and oppression
and anarchy." So far he preached familiar doctrine,
but he carried it into regions of his own.
International duty does not stop at non-aggression.
Every country has its positive duty to humanity; and
while evil is enthroned, and right can hardly hold its
own, and the eternal battle rages round, it may not
stand aside in cowardly forgetfulness. Mazzini abhorred
the doctrine of non-intervention&mdash;the principle
that no country may interfere in the domestic matters
of another,&mdash;a doctrine which the Americans and
Canning introduced for the protection of freedom, but
which less hardy statesmen in France and England
had perverted to excuse their own faint-heartedness.
If the principle had been generally accepted, if it had
meant for instance that France could not intervene at
Rome or Russia restore despotism in Hungary, it
might have worked successfully. But practically it
meant that "intervention was all on the wrong side,"
that only England observed the principle, and therefore
the one Great Power, which in some degree
stood for liberty, tied its own hands, while the Powers
that stood for despotism worked "their unhallowed
ends when, where, and how they thought fit" over
three-fourths of Europe. As Mazzini pointed out, the
theory took for granted a system based on nationality;
and where nationality was non-existent, as in Italy
and South-Eastern Europe, it had no rightful application.
At the best it was a "poor and incomplete"
doctrine. A country has its "bonds of international
duty," obligatory in proportion to its strength. "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
absolute doctrine of non-intervention in politics corresponds
to indifference in religion; it is a masked
atheism, a negation of all belief, of every general
principle, of any mission of a nation in humanity's
behalf." "Neutrality in a war of principles is mere
passive existence, forgetfulness of all that makes a
people sacred, the negation of the common law of
nations, political atheism. On one side," he was speaking
to Englishmen in 1859, "stands the flag of liberty
and right, of the true and good; on the other the flag
of tyranny and ambition, of the false and evil. And
you, a free nation and strong, you who profess belief
in truth and justice, would you say, 'Between evil and
good we will remain neutral, impassive spectators'?
It is the word of Cain. No people, that chooses to
teach that policy, may dare to call itself Christian, for
it is practically a people of atheists or cowards. Sooner
or later a tremendous expiation will visit the cowardly
desertion of the duty which God lays on peoples as on
individuals." "Can it be that England," he wrote
twelve years earlier, "the England of the Reformation,
the England of Elizabeth and of Cromwell, self-centred
in immoral indifference, gives up Europe to the dictatorship
of force?"</p>

<p>Hence he was no believer in peace at any price.
Sternly, indeed, he condemned war, when it was not
fought for a right principle; it was "fratricide," if not
imperative in the interests of the race. But it was
"sacred as peace, when the triumph of good is to be
its issue." He attacked the Manchester School for
perverting the sense of human solidarity. "Peace,"
he wrote to the Geneva Congress of 1867, "cannot
become a law of human society, except by passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
through the struggle, which will ground life and
association on foundations of justice and liberty, on
the wreck of every power which exists not for a
principle but for a dynastic interest." Europe, he
held, could not have lasting peace, till Austria and
Turkey made way for the nationalities, which they
held down; it would ever be perturbed by fears of
Russian aggression, till Poland was restored to be its
bulwark; and only war could free the Poles and
Southern Slavs. "When you have substituted justice
for tyranny, truth for falsehood, duty for selfish
interests, the republic for monarchy, then you will
have peace, but not till then."</p>

<p>Mazzini, unluckily, was not content with the broad
human principle that a country must use its strength
for right and freedom everywhere. He appended a
theory, which has its germ of truth, but defies definition,
and is easily twisted to save a special argument.
Each nation had, he thought, some distinct and
specialised service to render to humanity. "God has
written one line of his thought on the cradle of each
people." "Special interests, special aptitudes, and
before all special functions, a special mission to fulfil,
a special work to be done in the cause of the advancement
of humanity, seem to me the true, infallible
characteristics of nationalities." The theory escapes
any exact precision; but it offers a rich field for
poetry, and Mazzini's imagination was at home in it.
England's function was "industry and colonies,"
Russia's was the civilisation of Asia, Poland's "the
Slav initiative." Germany's mark was thought,
France's was action, Italy's thought in unison with
action. "While the German walks earth with his sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
lost in the depths of heaven, and the Frenchman's eye
rarely looks aloft but scours earth's surface with its
restless penetrating glance, the Genius, that guards
the destinies of Italy, has been ever wont to pass
swiftly from the ideal to the real, seeking from of old
how earth and heaven may be joined together." We
have seen what curious use he made of this theory of
special missions to rebut Irish claims.</p>

<p>Such were the principles of nationality, and nations
built on them would make the Europe of the future.
Mazzini believed that democracy would tend towards
large nations. He repudiated any love of administrative
centralisation and urged the widest local government;
but the bigger the nation, the more perfect, he
thought, would be the development of association within
it, and the greater therefore its momentum on the
road of progress. And, as the larger nations would
be approximately equal in territory or population, a
new and natural balance of power would arise to
safeguard peace. This liking for large countries
sometimes nearly led him into inconsistencies with his
own principles, and made him question the national
basis of most small states. He made a confident
forecast of the future European settlement. (He was
writing, of course, prior to 1870.) England and France
(apart from Savoy and Nice) were the only countries,
whose territory marched with their natural borders, and
they alone would remain unchanged. Italy would be
united, and include the border districts and islands
that spoke the Italian tongue, except, apparently, the
Canton of the Ticino. Germany, including the German-speaking
provinces of Austria, would also achieve its
unity, but be divided into two or three "great administrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
sections." Spain and Portugal would form
a single country. Greece would expand over all territories
with a Greek-speaking population. Switzerland
would be the nucleus of an Alpine Federation, embracing
Savoy and the Tyrol. Holland was, apparently,
to keep its independence; Belgium, on the other hand,
had no future as a nation, though he does not indicate
its destiny. In early life he seems to have thought
that Denmark would remain a separate state; afterwards
he believed that the three Scandinavian states
were inevitably destined to unity.</p>

<p>The most difficult problem, of course, was that of
Eastern Europe. Mazzini evidently thought that, next
to the unity of his own country, the Slav movement
was the most important question in European politics.
Here was a mighty people, awakening to life, proving
its power by its literature,&mdash;for it, he believed, had
produced the only living poetry since Goethe and Byron,&mdash;claiming
its rightful place in the European commonwealth.
Nothing could arrest the self-assertion of
the Slavs, but the future of Europe largely depended
on the direction which it took. If the other nations
hailed it and guided it, it would enrich the life of
Europe by the new elements it brought into it; if it
went unfriended and undirected, it would be perverted
into "Czarism," and cost Europe twenty years of
bloodshed to check Muscovite ambitions. Two things
Europe would do well to keep in mind. It was as
useless as it was immoral to bolster up Austria and
Turkey, for the Slav movement would be inevitably
fatal to them both. And Europe must see that the
Slavs became a barrier and not a help to Russian
designs of domination. This could be done, and done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
only, by helping the non-Russian Slavs to organise
themselves into powerful and independent nations.
Czarism owed its strength not to Panslavist aspirations,
but to the fact that the Czar was the only hope of
the Christian populations of the Balkans. Mazzini's
detailed forecast of the Slav national settlement varied
from time to time; but his favourite plan was that
Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Serbs should form four
separate nationalities. In curious and impossible
inconsistency with his own principles, he seems to
have thought that Hungary and Roumania would be
annexed to or federated with one or other of these
states; and he looked to a federal union of Serbs and
Greeks, with Constantinople, as a free city, for the
centre of the federation.</p>

<p>Out of the nationalities would grow "the United
States of Europe, the republican alliance of the peoples,"
"that great European federation, whose task it is to unite
in one association all the political families of the old
world, destroy the partitions that dynastic rivalries
have made, and consolidate and respect nationalities."
Mazzini's ken, strange to say, was almost restricted to
Europe. He scarcely mentions in this connection the
American United States, though sometimes he seems
perhaps to imply that they would enter the European
commonwealth. He had no inkling that Eastern races
might claim their own independent development.
His forecast of European colonisation hardly extended
beyond Asia and North Africa; he believed that Asia
was destined to be "an appendix of Europe," and that
the great stream of European colonisation would set
towards it, chiefly through the agency of Russia and
England. Thus he was concerned with Europe only;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
and for the Europe of the future, a federation of
harmonious nationalities, he had a splendid prophecy.
When nationality had triumphed, "all cause of war
would disappear, and in its place arise a spirit of
brotherhood and peaceful emulation on the road of
progress." Revolutions would be no more, and "the
slow, continuous, normal unfolding of activities and
powers" would lead the nations ever onwards. We
come again to his vision of a European authority,
sitting at Rome to give guidance and harmony to the
peoples. When the great day arrived, that brought
the victory of liberty and nationality, the peoples
would assemble their "true General Council." No doubt
the Council was the same as that which would define
the new religious faith. It would formulate the common
national duties of the peoples, and secure their freedom
to perform those duties, while the separate national
councils defined the special duty of each country.</p>

<p>It would be Italy's glorious function to lead the
nations to this unity. France had lost the opportunity
in 1815; England, when she isolated herself
from the life of Europe by her enslavement to non-intervention;
the Slav countries were disqualified by
their rivalries or obsequiousness to Russia. Italy
had her unquestioned titles to the proud hegemony,&mdash;her
geographical position, her character, her
traditions, the universal looking for some great thing
to come out of her new life. She was "the land
destined by God to the great mission of giving moral
unity to Europe, and through Europe to Humanity."
She would be the armed apostle of nationality, the
protectress of oppressed peoples, the instrument to
destroy Austria and Turkey and give freedom to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the Slavs. And when this part of her mission was
fulfilled, and through her nationality was victorious,
then the gratitude of the peoples, and the divine
appointment of Providence, and her own essential
fitness for the task, would make Rome the centre of
the cause of peace, the seat of the Diet of the nations,
fulfilling Dante's vision, that saw her "helmsman"
of humanity, to steer it to its peace. It was a
noble dream, much of it, it may be, fantastic and impossible,
and yet, perhaps, with its seed of truth.
The European Federation tarries behind Mazzini's
eager prophecy, but its coming cannot be delayed
for ever. The triumph of nationality, despite the
evil deed of 1870, has advanced with mighty strides
since his day. And though patriotism has often
erred into ignoble paths, and international fraternity
gone backward, yet the evil creates its own remedy,
and disarmament becomes an ever more importunate
desire. When the nations learn that arbitration
and disarmament are necessary for their
own self-preservation, when the European federation
gradually evolves itself, Rome will be the natural
seat of the High Court of Europe. Italy, which by
her plebiscitary origin has given a rule to the
nationalities,&mdash;a country practically without territorial
ambitions or colonial empire, the natural
mediator between the two great European alliances,
with her ancient prestige and service to humanity
to give her lustre, has paramount claims to the high
prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</p>

<p>If Mazzini's busy life could have spared more time
for literary study, he would probably have been
among the greatest critics of the century; perhaps,
even as it is, he may rank among them. He misses
in his lack of accurate and detailed study; but he
has a rare penetration and originality and gift of
embracing synthesis. It was his ambition at one
time to found an Italian school of criticism, whose
mark should be constructive and sympathetic interpretation.
Keenly sensitive though he was to beauty
of expression, he detested mere criticism of form and
the profitless microscopy, that pries for specks in a
writer's life or work. He loved to read a great author
reverently, hiding rather than exposing his blemishes,
penetrating below uncouthnesses of form and casual
lapses to the great informing thoughts, that had their
lesson for the world. "At the present day," he wrote
in an optimistic moment, "we neither worship a genius
blindly, nor outrage him barbarously; we set ourselves
to understand him, and we learn to love him. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
regard forms as secondary and perishable phenomena;
the idea alone is sacred, as a thing baptised to everlasting
life, and we try how we may lift the veil that
hides it." He compared genius to the fabled tree
of Teneriffe, whose branches discharged showers of
refreshing water. "Genius is like this tree, and the
mission of criticism should be to shake the branches.
At the present day it more resembles a savage striving
to hew down the noble tree to the roots."</p>

<p>In his scheme of life the poet had a part of supreme
importance. He regarded literature as a "moral priesthood."
Poetry would "save the world in its despite,"
for it was the poet's prerogative to redeem it from
doubt and base ideals, to "reveal duties and create
affections," to lift men up above the trivial things of
life to the eternal verities. "We have," he cries in
the forties, "exiled poetry from life, and enthusiasm
and faith have gone with it, and love, as I understand
love, and constancy in sacrifice, and the worship of
great deeds and great men." His own Italy had little of
the throbbing national life, in which alone true poetry
could flourish; and everywhere an age of faithlessness
robbed the poet of his aliment. The time was for the
critic,&mdash;the constructive, "philosophic" critic; he was
the "literary educator," and he could at all events be
precursor of the poet of the future, marking the lines on
which a modern democratic poetry should travel, and
preparing a public to understand him. "The critic," he
says, "is unrelated to genius; but he stands as a link
between great writers and the masses; he explores the
conditions and literary needs of the time, and preaches
them to the nations, that they may learn to feel them,
and desire and demand them; in fine, his prophecies prepare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
a public for the writer:&mdash;a more important
matter than some think, for very rarely do writers
appear before their time."</p>

<p>As critic, then, Mazzini points out the deficiencies of
contemporary literature, and the principles which must
take it to a higher stage. True art, he lays down, has
two great perils to avoid. First, there is the "atheist
formula" of 'art for the sake of art';&mdash;a heresy he
scourged with pontifical anathemas. His attack was
not aimed at perfection of literary form. He loved a
correct and classic diction, and never underrated style,
so long as style was not an excuse for poverty of
thought. His criticism went deeper. The artist may
not live his own art-life, divorced from the moving
world around and all its manifold activities, "floating
bubble-like without support," finding his poor inspiration
in his own fancies and caprices. There was no true
individuality in that; invented though it was to guard
the poet's independence, in reality it made him but a
passive mirror of each passing impression. Instead of
liberty, it brought anarchy and "wild, arbitrary intellectual
display." It robbed art of touch with the
great facts of life, all fruitful relationship to the
struggling, ever learning, ever advancing race. It sent
it wandering lawless, purposeless, like a sick man's
dreams. The poet ceased to be a thinker and a
teacher, and sank to a mere empty singer. "What I
want," he said, "is not the Artist but the man-Artist;
the High-Priest of the Ideal, not the worshipper of his
own Fetishes." Literature must be "the minister of
something greater and more valuable than itself."</p>

<p>He was almost equally condemnatory of realism,
especially of realistic presentation of nature. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
criticism that he brought alike against Monti and Victor
Hugo and Wordsworth, that they "depicted but never
transfigured nature," and thus their art was "useless."
The real is the mantle of the true, but not the true;
"high poetry is truth, because you cannot trace out or
analyse its source." The poet is a "miner in the
moral world"; his function is to hew beneath the
symbol, beneath the real, to the idea shut in within;
questioning nature alike in her beauties and deformities,
to find and teach to men "that fragment of God's
truth that must exist there." "One thing I know,"
he says, "that the phenomena of nature on their
moral side and the inner life of man must be the field
of modern literature, that physical nature and man's
outer life will have their place only as symbols of the
first." And nature's lessons must have a practical
reference to man's lot and destiny. Even when
nature was rightly used and interpreted, there might
be too much of it, and he seems to have always given
natural poetry a secondary place. "Poetry," he says,
"is not in nature but in man."</p>

<p>This brings us to his conception of true art. It
must be essentially human, not realistically so, but
usefully, practically, didactically. He did not mean
by this that it must confine itself to the obvious, outside
facts of life. "In every powerful poetic impression
the <i>vague</i> claims a full quarter, and the vague,
which must not be confounded with the obscure, is the
soul's own field." But poetry, however much it may
concern itself with the spiritual and unseen, must have
direct application to the problems of life. "Art lives
of the world's life; the world's law is art's law." The
poet must gather "the great voice of the world and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
God," and so interpret it, that men may listen and
profit. He must contemplate man both in his individuality
and as a social creature, "in his internal
and external life, in his place and with his mission in
creation." "Poetry,&mdash;great, ceaseless, eternal poetry,&mdash;exists
only in the development, the evolution of life:
only there, in life, understood and felt in its universality,
can inexhaustible variety be found."</p>

<p>Thus the poet must find his inspiration, not in his
own "incomplete, mutilated conceptions," not in the
isolated individual, but in the great collective, democratic
movements of the people, voicing their dim
thoughts and aspirations, "their latent, slumbering,
unconscious life." There can be no great poetry
to-day, unless the poet identify himself with "the
thought fermenting in the breast of the masses and
impelling them to action." Poets are the priesthood
of the social and political movement, which is the very
blood of a modern people; and there is no place for
individualist poetry in a social age. "True and sacred
art aims at the perfection of society," and the art of
the future will be "principally religious and political."
He hated the aimless art, that busies itself with the
mere picturesque and sentimental, which idealises ages,
whose meaning and moral standard have passed. He
applauded Schlegel's thesis that poetry must be
"national, that is useful and related to the civil and
political situation," no longer heedless of the great
movements of to-day, but "standing in the centre and
swaying the heart of the social impulse." The poet,
who went to fight for Greece and died there, typified
"the holy alliance of poetry with the cause of the
peoples."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>This democratic art must have a practical use by
being didactic and prophetic. It is not enough that
its heart should beat with the people's life; it must
help the progress of the race by pointing to the future.
Though it may "grow among the ruins, art is ever
coloured by the rising sun." "There can be no true
poetry without a presentiment of the future"; it is, as
said "the extraordinary man," who is the poet of all
time,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i6">The prophetic soul</p>
<p>Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come.</p>
</div>

<p>"Art either sums up the life of a dying age or heralds
one about to dawn; it is no caprice of this or that
individual, but a solemn page of history or a prophecy;
most powerful, when as in Dante, and occasionally in
Byron, it is both." But there is no gift of prophecy
without an ideal, and "literature, like politics, has
no secure foundation without its fixed beliefs and
principles,"&mdash;those beliefs which make the future and
to which facts must bow. "The true European writer
will be a philosopher, but with the poet's lyre in his
hands." "Nature with her thousand voices cries to the
poet, 'Soar, thou art King of earth.' And if we try to
pen him down to realism, and rob him of his independent
lordship over facts, the poets of the past will
answer from their graves, 'We were great, because we
created.' It is for poetry to take the creations of the
philosopher and give them life and colour, to explore
the truth that lies below the real and illumine it with
the light of genius, to interpret the universal laws that
rule over human history."</p>

<p>And the poet must not only lift men to his vision,
but send them forth in quest of it. He is not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
prophet but apostle. It is not enough that he should
stimulate thought; he must "spur men to translate
thought into action." "Contemplative" poets, Wordsworth
and Coleridge for instance, are "incomplete."
"The element of Action is inseparable from poetry.
Poetry," he says, "is for me something like the third
person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, which is action."
"In order to be a religious poet," he writes in criticism
of Lamartine, "it is not enough, in my eyes at least
to say 'Lord, Lord'; it is necessary to <i>feel</i> his holy
law, and to make others feel it in such sort, as that
they shall constantly and calmly act in obedience to
its precepts." Just as religion gives life and power to
philosophy, so it is for art to grasp ideas, translate
them by images and symbols, and make them
passionate beliefs. "Poetry is enthusiasm with wings
of fire, the angel of strong thoughts, the power that
raises men to sacrifice, consumes them, stirs a tumult
of ideas within them, puts in their hands a sword, a
pen, a dagger." "Written poetry, like music performed,
should be in some sense a prelude to other
poetry, which the excited soul of the reader composes
silently within itself." It will "teach the young all
that is greatest in self-sacrifice, constancy, silence, the
sense of solitude without despair, long years of torture
or delusion unrevealed and dumb, faith in the things
that are to be, the hourly struggle for that faith,
though hope of victory there be none in this life."
And therefore art must be ever brave and full of
hope, "teaching man not his weakness but his
strength, inspiring him not with faintheartedness but
with energy and vigorous will." Its song must be
always of steadiness and constancy, and "calmness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
radiate from the poet's brow, as the spirit of God
radiated from the brow of Moses on the wandering
Israelites." "The artist is either a priest or a more or
less practised mountebank." Woe to him, if he teach
spasmodic, evanescent effort, or "revolt and impotent
despair, that dies cursing, ere it tries to fight, that
says 'All things are evil,' because it finds itself unable
to create good." Mazzini has no pity for the poet of
pessimism, "whose sense of moral depression and
languor" will, if he pose as a religious poet, make his
readers "reject religion and him together."</p>

<p>Poetry, then, the modern poetry of action, being
essentially related to politics and social life, the poet's
themes are in the stir and passion of contemporary
events or in national history. What field for literature
like the mighty, moving pageant of the democratic
world? To watch God's hand guiding the nations to
their destinies, to probe the eager ferment of a modern
society, to interpret all the dim, half-conscious yearning
of the masses,&mdash;what inspiration for the poet
here! "Popular poetry has invaded everything, the
poetry whose epic is revolution, whose satire is revolt."
How strong and living are the giants of the Revolution
beside the nerveless men and women of the quietist
novel. "Poetry has fled from old Europe to give life
to the young, new, beautiful Europe of the peoples.
Like the swallow, it has left a crumbling ruin to seek
a purer air and a more verdant world. It has fled
from the King's solitary throne to find its abode in the
great arena of the peoples, in the ranks of martyrs for
the fatherland, on the patriot's scaffold, in the prison
of the brave betrayed." The armies of the Convention,
the guerilla-bands of Spain, the German students
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
chanting the songs of Körner on the march to battle,
the patriot's anguished passion, the dreams of a liberty
to be, the world-mission of European civilisation,&mdash;these
are the modern poet's themes. "Think you that
poetry, whose birth was ushered by such deeds as
these, can die ere it has lived? Would you set up
the poor, pale, narrow poetry of individuals, a poetry
of forms, a poetry that lives and dies in the small
circle of a palace or a chapel or a castle,&mdash;would you
set up this against the grand <i>social</i> poetry, solemn and
tranquil and full of hope, which knows none but God
in heaven and the people upon earth?" An age of
science and industry is no enemy to poetry, for the
elements of poetry are eternal. "I tell you, in this
Europe there is such life, such poetry in germ, the
poetry of ages, of all the generations, that genius itself
has not yet dared to attempt to develop it." "Here
round you," so he speaks to the poet of the future,
"here, before your eyes, there is poetry and movement
and a European people waiting for you."</p>

<p>The poet has another field in history. Mazzini
prophesied a great future for the historical drama.
He was inclined to think that drama would be the
accepted form of modern poetry, seeing doubtless that
drama is the true communion between poet and people,
the natural vehicle of the artist, who has a message to
deliver. It would be "a kind of popular pulpit, a
chair of the philosophy of humanity"; and he looked
forward to the day when the great dramas, such as
those of "divine Schiller," would be produced on the
stage without mutilations or curtailments to a reverent
and patient audience. The function of the historical
dramatist, as indeed he thought it was the function of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
the prose historian, was not so much to make minute
research of facts, as to disentangle the lessons hidden
under every page of history, to interpret the law of
human duty and the mystery of existence. Like every
other poet, he must start with a philosophy of life,
judging all things by his own law, meting out praise
and blame, drawing guidance for the future from the
past. The dramatist "may call up the shadows of the
past, but like the Witch of Endor, in order to constrain
them to reveal the future." His personages
must be types, each with its social significance; he
must not, as Victor Hugo did, overload them with
individual traits, till they lose their message for society,
but rather, as Schiller with his Marquis di Posa, so
"re-create" them, that they may illustrate some general
law of life. Mazzini did not see how pale such characters
would be; how difficult it was to reconcile them
with biographical accuracy, how likely therefore they
were to falsify any induction of historical laws.</p>

<p>His theory of music was a very similar one. Music,
like poetry, he thought, was nought without a moral
intention, without practical teaching and power to
inspire. It should be "the purest and most general
and most sympathetic expression of a social faith." He
pitilessly criticised the music of the thirties, imitative,
exhausted, artificial, clever but without creative power.
A faithless and corrupt generation asked for music to
amuse it; and music had listened and forgotten its
mission. There was melody and good instrumentation,
but no soul or thought in it. It was "laughter
without peace, weeping without virtue." Operas had
no unity, no great passionate note; they were ingenious
mosaics, much of them mere noise and extravagance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
inferior for all their technique to the chants of the
medieval Church, when music had a religious work to
do. Rossini had done something; he had broken
from the old canons and given liberty to music; but
he had the defects of the Romanticist school, he had
freed but could not create; he had prepared the way
for the music of the future, but it was not his to write
it. Mazzini however saw indications that the new
music was not far off, and its dawn, he believed,
would be in Italy. But Italian melody must wed
itself to German harmony. Italian music was "lyrical,
impassioned, volcanic, artistic," but without unity or
soul. German music knew God, but it was mystical
and impersonal, out of touch with everyday human
life. It dulled men's impulses to action; it stirred
them, but to no useful end, left the soul full of great
emotion, but uninspired to perform plain duties.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Mazzini was assured that Italy would produce the
master, who would unite the strength of both schools,
keep the religion of the German school, but point it
to practical, human ends. At one time he hoped
that perhaps Donizetti might live to do this; afterwards
he thought that Meyerbeer was "the precursor
spirit of the music of the future." He was
always thinking of Opera. When he insists that the
music should be in keeping with the subject and its
period, when he pleads for the symbolic use of the
orchestra, for the wider employment of motives, for
the development of the chorus on the model of Greek
tragedy, for the large use of recitative, for the entire
disuse of cadences and flourishes, he is looking to
Opera to be the highest form of music, as he looked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the historical drama to be the highest form of poetry.
Apparently he wished to wed them, and looked for the
day, when great poets would write librettos for great
composers.</p>

<p>Mazzini's criticism of music is for its time so fresh,
so full of suggestion and prophecy, that it is matter
for regret that his knowledge of it was not more
extensive. He knew opera and little beyond it;
he had some acquaintance with Beethoven, but he
does not seem to have been very strongly attracted
by him, or to have made much study of him. He
wasted on Donizetti and Meyerbeer the enthusiasm,
which should have been reserved for greater men. It
is unfortunate that he lived before Wagnerian opera
appeared in London. It would be possible to show in
detail to what a remarkable extent he anticipated
Wagner's theories.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Wagner, it is true, rejected the
historical drama, because he believed the requirements
of art to be incompatible with historical accuracy.
But his main doctrines are the same as Mazzini's,&mdash;the
ethical intention of music, the intimate relationship
of art to public life, the belief in the people as
the fountain of true art, the value of the folk-song, the
reconciliation of harmony and melody, the poet and
musician stretching hands to one another and giving
'moral will' to music, by uniting 'word' to 'tone'
in Opera. It is permitted to think that, Wagner's
nationality notwithstanding, Mazzini would have recognised
in him the master of the new music, whose
dawn he heralded.</p>

<p>Mazzini had a favourite classification of poets into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
"objective" and "subjective." The objective artist
sinks his own beliefs, and merely reflects and transmits
external impressions, neither judging them by his own
conception of right and wrong, nor supplying any
inspiration or rule of action for mankind. The subjective
artist stamps his themes with the imprint of
his own individuality; he sits in the seat of judgment
and measures out praise and blame; and thus he helps
others to form a moral law, and creates the future.
The former series, men who excite our admiration but
not our love, passes from the Greek poets, all save one,
through Shakespeare to Goethe; the latter from
Aeschylus through Dante and Michelangelo to Byron
and, apparently, Schiller. Dante was Mazzini's
highest type of the subjective poet. Something has
already been said of his influence on Mazzini's thought,&mdash;an
influence far greater than that of any other
writer. There are few, indeed, of Mazzini's doctrines,
which are not found in germ in the <i>Convito</i> or the
<i>De Monarchiâ</i>. Mazzini revered him as the strong
intellect, which took so little from other men and gave
so much; the hero, whose life was one long fight, who
"wrote for country, conspired for country, held the
pen and sword"; the patriot, "neither Catholic nor
Ghibelline nor Guelf, but Christian and Italian," who
believed in 'the holy Roman people,' and foretold for
Italy the spiritual mastery of the world; the thinker
who taught the unity and common task of all mankind;
the one true poet of love, to whom the love of
man and woman was a spiritual thing, wherein self
entered not. He contrasted him with Shakespeare
"the lord of individuality," the supreme dramatist
who created individuals as no man else has created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
them, giving his creatures choice of good and evil, and
pursuing the lesson of their fates, the choice once made,
to the end; who in Hamlet had of pure creative
genius made a prophetic type, that belonged to two
centuries after him, and had no contemporary
original. But Shakespeare was a man who took
life as he found it, untouched by strong moral sympathies,
without sense of the race or glimpse of
duty or looking to the future; therefore a cynic
and a "sceptic," obsessed by the feeling of life's
nothingness, with no illuminating faith in man's
predestined glory.</p>

<p>Mazzini's favourite contrast was between Goethe and
Byron. For Goethe's intellect he had the profoundest
admiration; he seems to have studied Faust carefully,
and had some acquaintance at all events with his other
works. "Goethe," he says, "is an intellect, that receives,
elaborates, and reproduces every possible form of
human emotion and aspiration. He dwells aloft,
alone, a mighty Watcher in the midst of creation,
scrutinizing with equal penetration and interest the
depths of ocean and the calyx of the flower, ...
laying bare in Faust the problem of the age in all its
terrible nakedness, ... the most representative poet
that Europe has produced since Shakespeare." But
great intellect as he is, he misses the highest; for he
loses the man in the artist, he has no moral standard
of his own, no sense of the unity of life; he is the
poet of detail and analysis, "feeling everything but
never feeling the whole," living aloof from religion and
politics, a cold spectator of the world-moving deeds
around him, "learning neither to esteem men nor to
better them, nor even to suffer with them," "without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
need of doing or sacred sorrow or any deep and ardent
love." "The poet of the bourgeoisie, he counsels
calm and contemplation, order and resignation, tells
men to fit themselves to their environment, fulfil their
little duties, plant themselves comfortably, do good
around them, always provided that the risks are not
too great, and that they do not disturb the harmony
and balance of the faculties of <i>sight</i>."</p>

<p>Turn from Goethe, he says, to Byron; "there is the
man himself, who hopes and strives and suffers for the
race, as Dante did, and as Aeschylus did before
Dante." Like Goethe, he too is "a poet of individuality,"
"a type of power without an aim"; but, unlike
Goethe's, his verse is no mere reflection of other men's
thoughts and actions. He stamps his portraitures
with his own personality, surveying the world "from a
single, comprehensive point of view," and interpreting
and judging it by his own inner light; more deep,
as Goethe is more vast, seeking the sublime rather
than the beautiful, ever a worshipper of force and action.
"In Byron the <i>ego</i> is revealed in all its pride of power,
freedom, and desire, in the uncontrolled plenitude of
all its faculties, aspiring to rule the world around him
solely for dominion's sake, to exercise upon it the
Titanic force of his will." It is this power of will,
necessarily propelled to seek an outlet in action, that
appealed so strongly to Mazzini. Byron bears his
part in the political and social conflicts round him,
"wandering through the world, sad, gloomy, and unquiet,
wounded and bearing the arrow in his wound";
loving and understanding Italy and Rome, dying
for a nation's cause in Greece. And Mazzini found
in his verse a great social lesson, such as Goethe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
never tried to teach. Consciously or unconsciously
Byron foretold the doom of individualism and aristocracy.
His characters are moulded on "a single type&mdash;the
individual; free, but nothing more than free;
iron souls in iron frames, who climb the alps of the
physical world as well as the alps of thought"; but all
bearing in their faces the stamp of failure, "a gloomy
and ineffaceable sadness." "Gifted with a liberty
they knew not how to use; with a power and energy
they knew not how to apply; with a life, whose
purpose and aim they comprehend not;&mdash;they
drag through their useless and convulsed existences.
Byron destroys them one after the other. The
emptiness of the life and death of solitary individuality
has never been summed up so powerfully as
in his pages."</p>

<p>But Byron, no more than Goethe, wrote the poetry
of Mazzini's ideal. In a generation without religion or
pity or enthusiasm, amid "English cant and French
levity and Italian stagnation," Byron was driven to
passionate, tumultuous cursings of a false society. But
it was a note of rebellion and despair. Neither poet
had the sense of the race, of man redeemed by love
and social service, of the new hope and power that
would come, as men learned to work together for the
common end. Mazzini gives no indication that he
ever found the art that he looked for. He seems
to have thought that some of the modern Slav poetry
came nearest to it. The new English literature does
not appear to have attracted him; there is no evidence
that he read Browning, and if he had, he would probably
have condemned him as "objective." Historical drama
has conspicuously failed to do what he expected of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
The poetry of social problems is still for the most part
analytic and destructive. The poet of his vision, the
constructive, prophetic, apostolic poet, with his message
for humanity, whose songs will reach the workshop
and the cottage and inspire a nation's policy, is yet
to come.</p>

<p class="s08 hanging">
Poetic temperament&mdash;Defects as a thinker&mdash;Greatness as a moral
teacher&mdash;Strength and weakness as a politician&mdash;The man.
</p>

<p>Carlyle said that Mazzini was "by nature a little
lyrical poet." The implication was contemptuous, but
it had a bottom of truth. Mazzini, indeed, save for
his early aspirations to the drama, never dreamed of
being a poet. His conception of the poet's function
was so high, the qualities he demanded of him so
exacting, that, if he ever felt the call, he put it away,
no doubt, as something to which he could not reach.
It is doubtful even whether he wrote more than one
poem when a youth. He aspired only to be critic,
to do something to prepare the way for the poet of the
future. But he had qualities, that would have made of
him a poet of no mean order. There are many passages
in his writings, which show his deep communion with
nature. When he writes of "the vast ocean, dashing,
like a wave of eternal poetry, against the barren rocks
of Brittany," or describes a sunrise from the Alps,&mdash;"the
first ray of light trembling on the horizon, vague
and pale, like a timid, uncertain hope; then the long
line of fire cutting the blue heaven, firm and decided
as a promise,"&mdash;truly the consecration and the poet's
dream are his. His critical essays prove with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
spiritual insight he would have touched the poetry of
man and society. We have seen how marvellous for
an outsider was his presentiment of the future of music.
And his whole intellectual make, alike in strength and
weakness, is that of the artist,&mdash;of the artist, that is, as
he conceived him, God's messenger to the heart of man.
He had little power of scientific thought, of accurate
reasoning or careful arrangement and analysis of facts.
It led to a curious misconception of scientific method.
"Science," he says,&mdash;"the true, great, fruitful science,&mdash;is
as much intuition as experiment." He generalises
with a hazardous confidence. Sometimes he uses words,
that are no more than words, to push difficulties into
a corner and stand in front of them. In spite of his
allegiance to "tradition," he generally prefers deductive
to inductive reasoning. "Principles prevail over
facts," as he says; but he often does not see, in spite
of his own cautions, how, without a supreme respect
for facts, a principle may hang not on the eternal
truths, but on the fancy of a solitary brain. His own
scientific studies were small; save for some acquaintance
with astronomy and geography,&mdash;the former to
feed his sense of the infinite, the latter for its relationship
to nationality,&mdash;he seems to have given no attention
to any branch of science. He accepted without
question the Genesis story of the creation of man.
At a time when Darwinism was bringing a sword into
the intellectual world, he lived apparently uninterested
and untouched by it.</p>

<p>The same defect of method appears in his other
studies. Keen as was his interest in social questions,
he evidently had no grasp of economic science; beyond
Adam Smith, it is doubtful whether he read any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the great economists, and at a later date he entirely
failed to understand the economic side of Karl Marx.
His theories of history, again, so subordinate everything
to his desire to make it didactic, that he regarded research
and accuracy as comparatively unimportant.
He thought,&mdash;rash man,&mdash;that facts had already been
accumulated in sufficient abundance and certainty.
Greatly indeed he conceived the historian's ultimate
function&mdash;to discover the laws of human progress, and
be "prophet of a higher social end"; but he slurred
over the difficulty of reading facts aright, and was ever
prone to let fancy take their place. He would have
made the historian's method deductive to a dangerous
degree, and had him fill the gaps of history from an
abstract study of human nature; he apparently approved
the Thucydidean method of invented speeches.</p>

<p>Here and everywhere he was apt to look down on
erudition. He believed that Genius,&mdash;a kind of mystic,
God-inspired faculty, that lived on intuition and not
on painfully acquired knowledge,&mdash;discovers at a
glance the secrets of nature and ethics and history.
"Where we see only the confused light of the Milky
Way, they see stars." Though he would have himself
disclaimed the title to genius, he had a supreme confidence
in his own thought. It was difficult for him
to own an error, and hence he never learnt from his
mistakes. It was true of him, as Renan said of
Lamennais, that "when a man believes that he possesses
all truth, he naturally disdains the painful, humble path
of research, and regards the investigation of details
as a pure dilettante fancy." This was no doubt the
chief cause why his mind so soon stopped growing.
We find in his early writings, when he was twenty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
or twenty-eight, the germ, and generally the
developed form of every doctrine that he preached.
His character developed normally, but not his intellect.
Religion, ethics, politics, social theories, literary canons,&mdash;all
issued forth at once from his early-ripened brain,
and fixed themselves once for all. He was always
reluctant to enquire for or admit new knowledge. It
is strange, lover of books though he was, how restricted
sometimes was his range of reading. His poets were
the poets of his youth and early manhood, and he read
few that wrote after 1840. Closely as he studied the
Gospels, he seems to have given little or no attention
to exegesis. In spite of his keen interest in Utilitarianism,
there is no trace that he read the later
writers of the school. Though so long in intimate
touch with English political thought, he does not seem
to have known Burke or Ricardo or the Mills or
Herbert Spencer.</p>

<p>As a thinker, therefore, his defects are great. His
thought, indeed, always has its value, coming as it
does from a man of very great intellectual power and
large experience of life, one who fearlessly penetrated
to the heart of things, and was therefore in the true
sense original. Its range is wonderful for one who
led so strenuous a life of action. Faulty as his
argument often is, obvious as are the gaps, he wrote
comparatively few pages, that are not stamped with
great and stimulating thought. But his mind was too
loosely organised, too often out of touch with contemporary
knowledge. He has left an imposing and
suggestive system, and yet perhaps it somehow fails to
add greatly to the sum of human knowledge. But it
is just the qualities, that depreciate him as a thinker,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
which make him great as a moral teacher. His want
of logic, his loose use of words hurt not here. The
involved and rushing language, like a tumbling mountain
stream, becomes a strength. That very rigidity,
that lifelong iteration of a few dominant ideas, carry
force and conviction, that a more agile intellect were
powerless to give. His warm and palpitating
generalisations, for all the flaws in their reasoning,
bear the irrefutable mark of moral reality. He had
that union of real intellectual force and spiritual
fervour, that gives the insight into moral truth, and
learns the secrets of heaven and hell. He was able to
be a great moralist, because in a rare degree he had
himself the moral sense, because the passion for
righteousness had so penetrated all his being, that he
could speak and be understood on the deep things of
God, had something in his own soul that found its
way to other souls. And, above all, he spoke with
authority. Absolute confidence in his own beliefs was
joined to truest personal humility, and made the
prophet. Humblest and least ambitious of men, he
felt his call from God; and in God's name he was
assertive, dogmatic, sometimes seemingly egotistic.
If he spoke authoritatively and intolerantly, it was
that a duty was laid upon him, and woe to him if he
preached it not. His principles were living and
victorious certainties to him. "If a principle is true,"
he said, "its applications are not only possible but
inevitable." And this unquestioning conviction made
him as fearless morally as he was intellectually,&mdash;fearless
with the supreme bravery of one who never
shrinks from duty,&mdash;fearless not only for himself but
others, bridling all the impulsive tenderness within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
him, and requiring of his fellow-workers the same
readiness for sacrifice, which he exacted of himself.
And so his words, aflame from a pure and passionate
heart, come with the intensity of prophetic power.
Beyond the words of any other man of modern times,
they bring counsel and comfort to those who have
drunk of the misery and stir and hope of the age.
They have the greater virtue, that impels their hearers
to do likewise. Mazzini is one of the small band, who
have the strength as well as the love of Christ, not
only the unselfishness that draws, but the conviction
and the power that command, who impose their own
beliefs and make disciples.</p>

<p>Would he, had he had the opportunity, have done
what he held higher than to teach through books, and
been the missionary of a religion? Had Italy been
freed in 1848, we may be sure he would have left his
desk, forsaken politics, and gone about the land,
preaching faith in God and Progress and Humanity.
Probably no other man, since the Reformation, has
had such apostolic power. Would his mission have
found an answer or ended in pitiable collapse? He
would probably have had no better fate than others,
who have tried to found new churches. There may
be room for new faiths, but there is little for new
churches in the world to-day. But this does not
necessarily mean failure. His church might have been
empty, his state religion proved a soulless husk; but
in the communion of scattered men and women, who
are groping for the truth, he might have laid a cornerstone
of that church, which is neither in this mountain
nor yet at Jerusalem, which without forms or unity of
doctrine, spreads the unity of spiritual truth. Something,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
even as it is, he has done for this. His creed
may fail to content the knowledge of to-day, but he
stands a convincing witness to the spiritual, to the
eternal needs of the soul, to religion as the master
fact of life, though creeds may fail and systems perish.</p>

<p class="p2">How does he rank as a politician? Our estimate
must be a mixed one. As a political thinker he
stands high. He has left a theory of the state, that
is priceless because informed by a great moral ideal.
And apart from this, it has its value from his wide
and profound knowledge of modern politics and the
practical sense that almost always keeps his idealism
in touch with facts. His faith in democracy, the
optimism which came of his trust in Providence,
his cautious handling of economic tendencies saved
him from the mistakes of Carlyle and Ruskin. His
conviction that the common-sense of the people was
feeling out its way independently of any theory or
school, kept him from the short-lived formulas of the
individualists. His deeper knowledge of men and
deeper reading of history gave him a saner and
completer view than that of the collectivists. None
of them, not even Ruskin, can match the warmth and
inspiration of a conception, that raises politics to be
the instrument of the divine plan,&mdash;an instrument
not only to destroy injustice and poverty, but to
redeem the highest part of man and bring the rule
of brotherhood and unity and social peace. In the
detailed application of his political doctrines he often
failed from that same inaccessibility to facts, which
marred him otherwise. His republic missed the
essential; his theories of democratic government are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
vague and hardly satisfy. But even here he is the
prophet of one great enduring principle. Among
the statesmen of the century, he is almost the only
one, who understood what nationality meant, saw its
essential relationship to democracy, and put it on
an unassailable foundation. It was this that made
him teacher of Italian Unity, and therefore maker of
modern Italy. Whether without him Italy would
be united to-day, we cannot tell; but at all events
it was he who gave the impulse, his bold vision that
saw that the hard consummation was attainable, and
gave others too the faith to see it.</p>

<p>As a political thinker, then, he is great; as a
practical political worker, he largely failed. True, he
had many of a statesman's qualities. He often read
character acutely, though his confidence in men
sometimes deceived him, and again and again he was
the victim of informers. He had rare industry and
considerable organising power; though, owing to his
solitary work, he had learned to bury himself too much
in details,&mdash;in the mass of correspondence and the
immense labour he put out to scrape together little
funds,&mdash;and in them he sometimes neglected the
survey of the whole. Above all, as he proved at
Rome, he had the true statesman's gift of leadership
and inspiration. But it is more than doubtful whether,
even under happier circumstances, he would have been
an effective politician. His knowledge of human
nature was more subtle in the abstract than in the
concrete; individuals were to him too much wholly
good or wholly bad, and he did not recognise how
complex are the motives that sway puzzled humanity.
He could rarely take a sane, unprejudiced view of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
situation. It amazes us that he expected Pio Nono
to respond to his appeal in 1847, and thought that, if
the republic came at Rome in 1870, it would found a
state religion. His misconception of Piedmontese
policy throughout the fifties is a yet stronger illustration
of distorted vision. This was one of the reasons
why he found it so difficult to compromise. He could
not distinguish non-essentials from essentials, and it
was nearly as hard for him to give way on the one as
on the other. Compromise in small or great seemed
cowardice, and there was no doubt a strain of egotism
in his obstinacy. It humiliated him to surrender any
detail of the theories, which he preached with such
undiscriminating confidence.</p>

<p class="p2">But one would fain close not with the thinker or the
moral teacher or the politician, but the man. Mazzini's
personal life was one of a very rare purity and beauty,
that stands out in his generation noblest and faithfullest
and most inspired. Its only serious flaw lies in
those few lapses from public candour, which have been
noted in these pages. Sometimes he was bitter and
intolerant, but the provocation was great. In earlier
life he was often querulous and self-absorbed, but it
may be counted to him, that, with his sensitive nature,
he came through loneliness and poverty with his moral
strength unbroken. Except for these, the critic's
microscope can find no specks. Brave, earnest, true,
without trace of affectation, he bore the stamp of
whitest sincerity. Gentle, affectionate, pure as few
are pure, he was friend and counsellor and inspirer to
those who knew him, gripping and subduing them with
that wondrous sympathy of his, that came of burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
love of goodness and made the saving of a soul the
highest thing in life. That generosity, which made
him share purse and clothes with others perhaps less
destitute than himself, and give half his scanty income
to help a woman and children that he hardly knew,
made him lavish out of his busy days time and
thought to help struggling souls. Ever intense in
his affections, grateful for any act of kindness, yearning
for friendship with the yearning of the homeless
man, he was one to draw others with bonds of love.</p>

<p>He had a large and loving view of life. Pettiness
and malice and jealousy had very little place in it.
Passionate though he was for morality, he was, outside
his political work and controversies and an occasional
touch of cynicism in his talk, a very tolerant man.
No person has, he said, "a right to judge a special
case without positive data on the nature of the fact."
He was angry and impatient with the "cavilling spirit
of mediocrity," that takes pleasure in the lapses of
"the mighty-souled." Among his friends he never
sermonised, and he had no desire to bend their private
life to his own pattern. Ever more or less sad himself,
he rejoiced in their happiness. "You are a happy
mortal," he writes to one of them on his marriage. "I
am, notwithstanding my dislike for <i>happiness</i>, truly
glad that you are so." Never man had more joy in
others' home felicity. It was only among his fellow-revolutionists,
whom he thought of as partners in his
own high call, that he was exacting and sometimes
ungenerous, though he pleaded earnestly with them
that public work should leave room for the inner life
of love and friendship. In his political controversies,
it must be confessed, his equanimity deserted him, and
he is often intolerant and unfair. He was too ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
think that bad politics implied bad morals, and his hatred
of Louis Napoleon and Cavour made him pen pages, that
one would gladly not remember. But even in politics
he could sometimes do justice to an opponent, who
obviously acted from high convictions; and he was one
of the few Italian nationalists, who could appreciate
the motives of the Catholic Volunteers.</p>

<p>But his essential greatness lies on the active side.
Above all else he shines out white in that consuming
love of humanity, that accepted poverty and weariness
and danger, that made him forego home and love,
comfort and congenial work, and give himself to one
long, self-forgetting service for the good of men.
Duty was no abstract precept with him, but part
of his very being. In adversity and trial he had
schooled himself to follow her, till disobedience to her
call became almost impossible, and he did not wait for
her to speak but sought her out. It was nearly allied
to his almost superstitious fear of personal happiness.
Those miserable years in Switzerland and London
wrought on him, till melancholy grew to a habit. He
lost something of it afterwards in the society of his
English friends, but it never left him; and it tinted all
his life with the gentle sadness, which is near akin to
spiritual yearnings and large-hearted love. Sunless and
unwholesome as it seems at times, after all, as with the
Man of sorrows, it purged him to the same forgetfulness
of self. It was no enervating grief; "do not allow
yourself to be weakened and self-absorbed by your
trouble" was his perennial lesson to friends, who had
lost dear ones. His was the "other part of grief, the
noble part, which makes the soul great and lifts it up."
"By dint of repeating to myself," he once wrote to Mrs
Carlyle, "that there is no happiness under the moon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
that life is a self-sacrifice meant for some higher and
happier thing; that to have a few loving beings, or if
none, to have a mother watching you from Italy or
from Heaven (it is all the same) ought to be quite
enough to preserve us from falling." He, to a degree
that few have done, trod self victoriously under; habitually
and systematically year by year, untempted by
failure or success, by misery or comparative happiness,
he denied himself even the little indulgences and relaxations
and declensions from the strait hard path,
by which most good men make their compromise
with the world and flesh. So remorselessly was duty
law to him, that sometimes work and sacrifice became
ends in themselves; and he laboured painfully on in
the path which he had chosen, when it would have
served his cause better to have rested or turned to
other activities. And the unbending labour had its
fruit in that wonderful sum of his life's work, that,
beyond all the exacting details of his political
organisation, has left its stamp on modern Europe,
has left so vast a body of thought in half the
provinces of the human mind, has its yet richer
legacy in the example of a life given perfectly and
wholly to the cause of men.</p>

<p>He was not the mere conscientious worker only;
he lived in the light of a spiritual vision, and that
light radiated in almost every page he wrote, on every
man and woman whom he touched. Besides the
sense of duty he had faith. "He was," writes a living
English statesman, "perhaps the most impressive
person I have ever seen, with a fiery intensity of
faith in his own principles and in their ultimate
triumph, which made him seem inspired; a man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
waken sleeping souls, and fill them with his own
fervour." He loved to commune with those of his
own spiritual kin,&mdash;Dante, Savonarola, Cromwell,&mdash;men
who had the same undoubting faith in the
righteousness of their cause and their fellow-work
with God,&mdash;men, it may be, one-sided and intellectually
incomplete, but gifted with the power to do great
things and lift up life. And so great principles and
nobleness of aim carried him through a series of
practical mistakes, and left his life to be a permanent
enriching of the race. What if he dreamed dreams,
that for generations yet may be no more than dreams?
What if his mental ken reached not to all the knowledge
of the age? What if he marred his work
by mistakes and miscalculations? His errors have
passed; his intellectual limitations can be supplied.
His was the rarer and the greater part, to lift men
out of the low air of common life up to the heights,
where thought is larger, and life runs richer, and the
great verities are seen, undimmed by self and sophistry.
The idealist is still mankind's best friend; and he
does most for the race, who purges its spiritual vision,
and breathes into cold duty, till it becomes a thing
of life and passion and power. Greater still is he,
who is not idealist only, but saint and hero, and in
his life bears witness to the truth he teaches. Such
saint and hero and idealist Mazzini was; and while
men and women live, who would be true to themselves
and to their call, who value sacrifice and duty above
power and success, so long will there be those, who
will love him and be taught by him.

<span class="smcap">Letter to</span> Mr <span class="smcap">W. E. Hickson, Editor of the</span> <i>Westminster
Review</i> (probably in 1844).</p>

<p>
[This letter gives some details concerning his early life, which
are not mentioned in his works or in any of the biographies.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I began to attract the attention of the Government
in Italy by my literary writings. I had been pleading warmly the
cause of what was then called Romanticism, and was the right of
progressive life in Literature. Then, as now, all pleading for
literary liberty, independence, progression, were suspected in
Italy as educating the mind to forbidden tendencies. I published
in 1828 a weekly literary paper the "Indicatore Genovese": it
was, at the end of the year, and though published under the double
ecclesiastical and temporal censorship, suppressed. I caused the
paper to be continued at Leghorn under the title of "Indicatore
Livornese";<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> it was, at the end of the year, suppressed again. I
wrote one long article on "a European Literature" in the best of
our reviews, the "Antologia" of Florence. The review was persecuted
and after some time suppressed. In 1830, after the
Revolution of July I was arrested. The accusation was the
spreading of a secret association tending to the overthrow of the
Italian Government. I recollect a fact, well apt to give a summary
of our condition in Italy. My father, Professor of Anatomy in the
Genoese University, went to the Governor of the town, Venanson,
enquiring at the cause of my imprisonment. "Your son," he was
told amongst other things, "is fond of walking every night, alone,
sadly pensive, on the outskirts of the town. What on earth has
he at his age to think about? We don't like young people
thinking, without our knowing the subject of their thoughts." A
committee of Senators was appointed, in Turin, to try me. They
found no proofs, and acquitted both me and some friends who had
been arrested with me. Nevertheless I was sent, in solitary confinement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
at Savona, in the fortress for five months: and afterwards,
sent in exile, without leave of seeing anybody, except
my parents. There was no duration determined; but I was
told that my subsequent conduct would shorten or prolong the
time of my being an exile. I came through Savoy and Switzerland
to France, at a time in which the Government of Louis Philippe,
not yet acknowledged by the absolutist Governments, was active
in exciting all insurrectional schemes, both in Spain and Italy. I
merged, of course into them.</p>

<p>When the insurrection of 1831 was quenched in the Estates of
the Pope, I established myself at Marseilles, and founded from
there the new association "la giovine Italia." Of the distinctions
to be made between this and the old Carbonari associations, I
have spoken in four letters that have been printed in the "Monthly
Chronicle." They&mdash;the fourth especially&mdash;I would advise you to
peruse: I have not a single copy in my possession and cannot
even remember the number; but they must have appeared between
1838 and 1839. The rapidity with which the Association spread
evinced the justice of the fundamental views. At the beginning
of 1832, the organisation was powerful throughout all Italy. As
one of the main features of La Giovine Italia was to not content
itself as Carbonarism did, with a secret war, but to reach insurrection
through the open preaching of its belief, an organ was
established at Marseilles expounding all the principles of the
Association. La Giovine Italia, a review, or rather a collection
of political pamphlets springing from the Association, was under
my direction; and, in fact, the two-thirds of each volume were my
own. The effect was really electric among our youth. From
Marseilles, through the merchant-ships of our country, the
captains of which were almost generally volunteering their
efforts, the volumes were smuggled into Italy, where they raised
the enthusiasm of the patriots to such a pitch that it was evident
a general outbreak would ensue. Then, the persecutions began.
Applications were made by all the Italian Governments to the
French: the policy of Louis Philippe had already changed, and
the most active co-operation against the Association and me was
promised. Measures were taken at Marseilles against such of our
exiles as were living upon the <i>subsidies</i>. They were sent away to
the interior. But few as we were, we could, by multiplying our
activity, front the task. At last, under the pretence of my being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
likely to be connected with the republican agitation in France, I
was ordered to leave France. I protested, and claimed the
common justice of a trial; but unsuccessfully. My presence at
Marseilles was imperiously required by the interests of the
Association; the writing, publishing, and sending to Italy the
correspondencies with the country, for which Marseilles was
offering every facility, the interviews with Italian patriots who
flocked to Marseilles for instructions and communications,
were all resting on me. I decided to stop; and concealed
myself. During one year I succeeded in baffling all the
activity of the French police, and of our own spies. But
it was through the most rigorous seclusion you can imagine.
During one year, I remember having had only twice, a
breath of fresh air in the night, once dressed in woman's garb,
the other as a Garde-National. At last things had reached
such a point that a general rising was thought of. I left France
and went to Geneva: there to await for the event, and prepare an
expedition into Savoy, so as to divide the forces of the enemy and
establish co-operation between the patriots in Italy and their
exiles. How the hopes of an insurrection failed in Italy, the
fourth of my letters in the "Monthly Chronicle" will tell you.
How we too failed, through our military leader, General Ramorino,
in the attempt on Savoy&mdash;an attempt I thought it our duty to
realise, as a practical teaching to our countrymen, that promises,
once given, are to be kept,&mdash;would now be too long to say. But a
tolerably true account of the enterprise is to be found in one of
the volumes of "Histoire de Dix Ans" <i>par</i> Louis Blanc. Meanwhile
the attempt, once unsuccessful, drew upon Switzerland and
<i>à fortiori</i> upon me, the anger of all Governments. Notes were
literally showering upon the poor Swiss Cantons, where we sojourned.
The most of us left Switzerland for France or England.
I with few others remained. Driven away from Geneva, I went
to the Canton de Vaud: driven away from there, to Berne.
There, owing to the friendship of some of the members of the
Government, I stopped for some time, keeping a very secluded
life. At last the insistence of the foreign Embassies prevailed
upon the weakness of the Bernese Government, and I was obliged
to go to Solothurn. Meanwhile the principles, embodied in our
writings and in our associations had awakened the sympathies of
the Swiss patriots. A National Association was founded on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
ground of brotherhood with our own. The persecutions with
which the unwilling but weak Swiss Governments were hunting
me, excited almost as much indignation as the opening of the
letters here. The weakness of the Cantons had its source in the
deficiency of national unity, in the detestable organisation of the
Central Power, on the old <i>Pacte Federal</i>, forced by the Allies on
Switzerland at the overthrow of Napoleon. I was requested to
write a periodical advocating and unifying under our political
belief, the national feelings. Funds were given. The "Jeune
Suisse" was established. It appeared twice a week in French and
in German, for the course of one year. Through the German
exiles, and working-men, through the Tyrolese working-men,
rather numerous in the Canton of Zürich, through the Italian
Tessin, and the frequent contact with Italian people travelling to
the frontier, the spirit of liberty began to spread again in the
countries approaching Switzerland. The terrors of the Governments
re-excited the persecution. They threatened Switzerland
with war. German troops came to the frontier, M. Thiers was
menacing to ruin Swiss commercial resources with a "blocus
hermetique." We were sent away. The paper suppressed; the
most horrible calumnies spread against us: all exiles left with or
without compulsion. I decided to remain as long as necessary to
prove to the Swiss people, that they were the slaves of the Foreign
Powers, and devoid of all real liberty, of all independence. During
seven months, I went from place to place, from house to house,
living in places apparently empty, with mats at the windows,
without even going beyond the room, except when receiving
advices of the house being suspected: then with a guide, I was
crossing the mountains in the night, and going to another shelter.
While the Governments were raging, I received from all classes
of population marks of sympathy that made and still make me
consider Switzerland as a second Fatherland. Ministers [of religion]
were inviting me to their houses as one of their family. [At]
Grenchen, a village of a thousand inhabitants, near Solothurn,
when I had spent one year, in an establishment of baths, I was,
during the storm, made citizen spontaneously and without expense.
The poor people, good souls of the village, believed that as a
Swiss citizen, I would be respected; the grant of course, was not
admitted. Still had I been alone, I would have, hardened as I
was to all privations, kept on resisting; [but I was not alone] so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
decided to leave and come to England. It was then that I had
a correspondence with the Duke of Montebello, which ended in
his sending three passports for us to a place I named; and in
January or February 1837 I landed in England.</p>

<p>The "Giovine Italia" had six volumes published at different
times. All that I have ever written concerning politics bears my
name. Before I established the Association I wrote a long letter
to Charles Albert, who had just then come to reign over Piedmont,
remembering him of what he had promised and done, when not a
king, pointing to him all the dangers of his position, the impossibility
of keeping down long the spirit of the nation, the system of
blood-shedding reaction to which he would soon be bound, and on
the other side, the Possible, the Beautiful, the Grand, the Godlike
that there would be in his putting himself at the head of the
National party; the letter was printed, and signed only "An
Italian." My name was then quite unknown, and would not have
added the least weight to the considerations; besides, I did not
believe that the "Italian People" would ever spring from under a
royal cloak; and I was writing, not my own opinion, but that of
many of my countrymen still fond of such a hope. I wanted to
have the true intentions of the man on whom they relied, as much
as possible unveiled. As soon as the letter reached him, my
"signalement" was given to all the authorities of the coast, so as
to have me arrested if ever I attempted to cross the frontier
again.... I have been in 1833 condemned to be shot <i>in the
back</i> by a military commission sitting in Alessandria, as having led
from without the agitation. Here in London I have exerted, as I
will exert, what influence I possess with my countrymen to endeavour
to raise them from the nothingness and worse than
nothingness in which now they are; from English affairs I have
kept myself entirely separated; nor sought the help of English
people even for our Italian affairs. As to all the present agitation,
I had nothing to do with it, on the beginning. I did not think
that the time was properly chosen. But, when the patriots of the
interior <i>decided</i> that they <i>would</i> attempt, nothing of course, was
left to me than helping them; and so I did, or rather prepared me
to do so, should a rising take place.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the right of an Italian to work out from whatever
place he finds himself in, the welfare of his country, ought to
be clearly and boldly asserted by an English writer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p>Of the hopes I have of the Italian patriots succeeding at a not
very remote period, in what they are now struggling for, I cannot
now speak here. It would prove too long a subject for a letter;
but I am in intention, if I find time for it, of publishing very soon,
a Pamphlet on the question, showing how, all weary of slow, legal,
national progress being interdicted to us, our only hope must lie
in insurrection as the starting-point for a national education. If
there are points upon which you want more notions, be so kind as
to write, and meanwhile, with sincere thanks for the interest you
take in my case, believe me now dear Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p>
[The original is in French. It has probably not been published
before. It was sent in 1846 to Mr William Shaen in response to
a request for a paper on the abolition of slavery. It was to have
appeared in Lady Blessington's <i>Keepsake</i>, presumably in a translation,
but was not published in it. In sending it Mazzini writes:
"To write one or two pages on abolitionism is just the same to me
as to prove that the sun gives light and warmth; or to prove an
axiom. So that I was during one full hour at a loss what to
write, till my soul melted away in prayer."]
</p>

<p>God of pity, God of peace and love, forgive, oh forgive the
planters. Their sin is great; but thy mercy is infinite. As of old
thou didst make refreshing waters gush from the desert rock for
the multitude of thy servants, so now make the living spring of
charity gush out in the desert of their souls. Let the angel of
repentance descend and settle on their dying pillow. And between
them and thy justice, at their last hour,&mdash;for them and for
their country, which they dishonour,&mdash;may the prayer rise up of
all who suffer for thy holy cause, for thy holy truth, for the freedom
of the peoples and of the Soul of man.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Their sin is great. They have sinned, they are sinning still
against thee and against Humanity, which is the interpreter of thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
law on earth. The Spirit of Evil, which tempted Jesus, thy son
so dear to Genius and to Love, by offering him, when he began
his divine career, the riches and the thrones of earth, has also
tempted them, men bereft of Genius and of Love, by taking
the semblance of the idol, which is self-interest. They have
yielded. They are the bondsmen of the senses, and have forsworn
knowledge and feeling. They have set the slave in the
place of man, the fetish of the sugar-cane in the place of thy
holy image. But thou, didst thou not hear thy son, so dear to
Genius and to Love, when he prayed for those who slew him?
Forgive them, Father, forgive the planters too.</p>

<p class="p2">Thou hast placed, as symbol of the eye of thy Providence,
one sun in heaven for the earth. Thou hast interwoven in one
mighty harmony, of which human Music, Religion's eldest child,
is but a faint and stammering echo, the worlds, those finite rays
of thy infinite Thought, that move around us, like the scattered
letters of a heavenly alphabet, which we shall know one day. In
this fair physical Universe, which is the garment of the Idea,
thou hast everywhere taught Unity, and the bright light of thy
teaching shines upon their souls; but they have veiled the eyes
of their souls, they have broken in pieces that which is so fair,
and on the wreck of thy Unity they have built a warring Dualism:
two natures, two laws, two ways of life. Have pity, Lord,
forgive, oh forgive the planters.</p>

<p class="p2">In History, which is thy life, manifesting itself progressively in
time and space, thou hast set in their sight another fount of truth,
whence in great waves flows the great thought of Unity, which is
thy whole Law. Thou madest all mankind spring from one Adam;
at the teaching of thy providence, more clearly seen from day to
day, thou hast led man, collective, social man, from slavery to
serfdom, from serfdom to wage-earning; and that nought may
be wanting to make the progression clear, thou makest now the
nations to desire impatiently that to wage-earning association
may succeed. And over these three stages, which are the image
of thy triune working, hovers the holy voice of Golgotha, <i>All ye
are brothers, for ye are all one in God</i>. And they have stopped
their ears to the holy voice of Golgotha, they have shut their eyes
to the evolution of Thought in History: they have said: <i>we are</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
<i>not brothers, we are masters and slaves</i>. They have kept one
page alone of the Great Book, the page that tells of Cain and
Abel, of Violence and Right; and they have said to themselves:
<i>there are then two races of men, the race that is accursed, and the
race that is privileged, and of this last race are we</i>; they know
not that the sign of thy curse is on their own forehead, since it is
by Violence alone that they make slaves of men. Have pity,
Lord, forgive, oh forgive the planters.</p>

<p class="p2">And for the third witness of thy Truth, thou hast put a voice in
each man's heart, an impulse in each man's conscience, which
says: <i>I am free; free because I am responsible, free because I am
a man, made in God's image, inherently possessing in myself the
powers and aspirations and destinies of all Humanity</i>. And they
have denied that this is the voice of all men. They have shut
themselves up in their selfish <i>Ego</i>, and have said: <i>this voice is
ours alone</i>, and they see not, wretched men that they are, that if
they put a bound to it, they blot it out from all creation, since God
did not create the <i>planter</i> but the <i>man</i>. They have sown hate,
and they will reap revolt: they have denied the God of love, and
they have provoked the God of vengeance. Listen not to their
blasphemy, O Lord. Forgive, oh forgive the planters.</p>

<p class="p2">O Lord, open their understandings and soften their hearts. Let
the angel, that inspires good thoughts, descend upon them in
their dreams by night. Let them hear through him the cry
of horror that ascends from all Humanity that believes and
loves;&mdash;the sorrowing cry of all who endure and fight for the
Good in Europe, and whose confidence and faith is shaken by
their stubborn crime;&mdash;the mocking cry of the princes and kings
of the earth, who, when their subjects are full of turmoil, point to
the proud republicans of America, who alone of men maintain the
helotism of pagan ages;&mdash;the long anguish of Jesus, who, because
of them, still suffers on his cross to-day! And when in the morning
they awake, let their children lay their innocent curly heads
beside their lips, and whisper, inspired by thee: "Father, father,
free our brother, the black man; buy and sell no more the son of
man for thirty pennies; see, this black man too has a mother and
little children like us; Oh that his old mother could rejoice to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
him proud and free! that his children could smile on him, fresh
and happy, in the morning, as we smile now on you, father."</p>

<p class="p2">God of pity, God of peace and love, forgive, oh forgive the planters.
Their sin is great, but thy mercy is infinite. Open in the desert
of their souls the living spring of charity. Let the angel of repentance
descend and settle on their dying pillow. And between
them and thy justice, at their last hour,&mdash;for them and for their
country, which they dishonour,&mdash;may the prayer rise up of all,
who, like myself, suffer for thy holy cause, for thy holy truth, for
the freedom of the peoples and of the Soul of man.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mrs Peter Taylor</span> [May 15, 1847].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs Taylor</span>,&mdash;First of all let me tell you that my
silence before your note has been owing to my having been most
unpoetically ill, with head-ache, sore throat, prostration of forces,
fever and other things, till I was thinking that Mr Taylor would
perhaps get rid all at once of me and of the League: however
Hom&oelig;opathy&mdash;that is taking nothing&mdash;has cured me: then that
my silence after the note has been owing to a hope in which I have
been indulging both on Friday evening, and on Saturday, to call
on you unexpectedly and talk instead of writing. However that
hope too&mdash;the other is Mr Taylor's hope&mdash;has vanished: and I
find myself having so much to do that I doubt whether I will find
a moment of freedom this week. So, I write, and hope to be
forgiven for the past.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>And now to Poetry. Alas! After mature consideration, I find
no <i>definition</i> at all; by <i>you</i> it is not needed; I am sure you have
the <i>thing</i> in your own Soul, and that is better than all definitions
one could supply; for Mr Taylor I fear no definition of mine
would do. Suppose I gave a definition that seems to me very
true, but that I ought to explain in ten pages at least. "Poetry is
the feeling of a former and of a future world"<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>: he would find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
that it belongs to Byron, and would find himself pledged to refuse
it. Suppose that I gave one of mine:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Poetry is the Religion of the individual Soul."</p>
<p>"Religion is the Poetry of the collective Soul."</p>
</div>

<p>I fear that not only he, but perhaps you too, would ask for
explanations which would fill up a lecture, not a note. Suppose
that I quoted lines like these:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i10">"A Poet's art</p>
<p>Lies in tolerating wholly, and accounting for in part</p>
<p>By his own heart's subtle working, those of every other heart"</p>
</div>

<p>he would say that that is charity, and nothing else; <i>we</i> would
say that it is incomplete. Suppose that I adopted yours&mdash;which,
with due comments and interpretations, I am not far from&mdash;that
"Poetry is the soul of the Universe," it would not avail. You
gave it already, I am sure, and it was declared unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>We must one day or other <i>talk</i> about this. I fear vaguely
that even <i>we</i> do differ in some way respecting the essence of
Poetry. I suspect that you leave out in your own definition the
element of <i>Action</i>, which seems to me inseparable from it.
Poetry is for me something like the third person of Trinity, the
Holy Spirit, which <i>is</i> Action. But this amounts to declare
incomplete, the poetry, for instance, of Wordsworth, Coleridge,
etc. Is that a heresy for you? If so, our definitions will not
agree.&mdash;ever faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Jos. Mazzini.</span></p>

<p class="center p4">IV</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mr Peter Taylor</span> [February 16, 1854].</p>

<p>[This letter is inserted, because of its historical importance.
It is, I believe, the earliest existing mention of any scheme for a
French protectorate in Tuscany. It also antedates by a few
weeks the earliest known mention of Garibaldi's scheme for an
expedition to Sicily. Mazzini's information respecting Louis
Napoleon's plans was probably derived from Dr Conneau, but it
was generally inaccurate.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I write because I have no time for coming,
and I write, I must avow, to silence conscience, with very little
hope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>Do not smile, and say "the man is mad"; but put your head
in your two hands and try to solve this question: "is there any
earthly way of getting one thousand pounds in a very short time,
ten days, a fortnight at the most?"</p>

<p>With you I have no secrets, and I shall state to you summarily
the why.</p>

<p>We <i>must</i> act: as early as possible in March: in fact as soon
as the declaration of war or an action amounting to the same
takes place, we must <i>act</i>, because the initiative is everything for
us.</p>

<p>The actual schemes of the French Emperor, assented to by
your cabinet, are these:</p>

<p>A Muratist movement in Naples: reinforcements in Rome
ready to help, as Piedmont would object to the establishment
of a French dynasty in the South. France offers to patronise
the King of Piedmont to the North of Italy. Lombardy will be
Piedmontese. But Lombardy and the Venetian territory would
together with Piedmont form too large, too threatening a state.
Lombardy and Venice shall therefore be divided. Venice like
Greece will be given up to some foreign prince, or to Austria
again if Austria yields and submits in other respects. Rome
will remain to the Pope. Only as there are provinces so
disaffected that the case is hopeless, from them and Tuscany
a central Dukedom or Princedom will be formed under French
patronage. Sicily will be given&mdash;the old scheme of 1848&mdash;to
the Duke of Genoa, son of the Piedmontese king.</p>

<p>Thus Italy will have two more divisions, Sicily and Venice;
new foreign dynasties would be settled there, new interests would
group themselves around them: a new partition would begin,
with high sanction, a new phasis, and we should have to begin
anew our secret work, our clandestine printing, our series of
martyrdoms, as if nothing had been done.</p>

<p>To all this I know only of a [one] remedy: to initiate: to give
the leadership to the national party. The multitude will follow
the first who acts; the very elements prepared by all these
intrigues will accrue to us if we move first.</p>

<p>And beyond all, to move in the South. We would thus check
the French scheme before its realisation. As we would, for the
present, leave Rome aside and untouched, we do not damage in
the least the actual position of England with France.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>Garibaldi is here: ready to act. Garibaldi's name is all
powerful among the Neapolitans, since the Roman affair of
Velletri. I want to send him to Sicily, where they are ripe for
insurrection and wishing for him as a leader.</p>

<p>Of course another action would simultaneously take place in a
point of the centre, and I would lead a third operation in the
North.</p>

<p>For these two, I have, though very little, still enough of money.
For the first, that is for Garibaldi, I have none, and claiming
it from Italy would imply expenses for travellers, risks, the
unveiling of the secret, and <i>uncertain indefinite</i> time.</p>

<p>Are there not to be found in England ten persons willing for
the sake of Italy and for the sake of baffling schemes of French
domination absolutely antagonistic to English interests, to take
each £100 of our National Loan notes?<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>&mdash;or twenty ready to
take £50 each?</p>

<p>This is the problem.</p>

<p>I know nobody almost. It must be the work of some Englishman.
If any plan could be devised of certain fulfilment, but
requiring longer time, the sum could be perhaps advanced by
some person who would keep all that would come in by degrees.</p>

<p>&mdash;ever yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mr Peter Taylor</span> [October 26, 1854].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Are you astonished at our inertness? at
our talking so much and doing so little? I often think that you
feel so. I could explain everything in two hours of conversation;
but take my word in spite of all, we are ripe for the aim, and
that ere long we shall reach it. In fact, had I not been exceptionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
prudent and calm, action would have been already
initiated. It would be any day, were it not for Piedmont and
the "Western Powers." Piedmont is our curse.</p>

<p>First, on account of its enjoying liberty, it is so much withdrawn
from the field of action; then we have, just as in 1848,
a whole world of courtiers, of ministerial agents, of journalists,
and even of clandestine-press-writers, spreading everywhere
that the King will draw the sword one of these days, that France
and England will cause the revolution to spring up in Naples,
that you will quarrel with Austria about the Principalities, that
a better opportunity will come, must come, if only we have
patience for one month, for two months, for two weeks. There
was a whole dream-dispelling work to be done before thinking
of immediate action. This work is, for the two-thirds, done,
the other third will take, perhaps some two months. The field
will be mine then. The people, the working-classes, are
admirable: they are mine, mine devotedly to blindness.</p>

<p>One thing is out of doubt: any <i>initiative</i> will be an Italian
one: one spark will settle the whole on fire, only, the <i>initiative</i>
<span class="s08">MUST</span> be a successful one. This is the source of all my delays.
I feel too certain of success after the first blow being struck for
my risking uncautiously the first blow.</p>

<p>The English agitation I am trying to spread would be of real
importance to me, if taking a certain degree of <i>consistence</i>, both
from the financial point of view and from the moral one. You
have not an idea of how proud and stronger my working men do
feel here, when they find themselves noticed, encouraged and
helped in England. I trust you will do what is in your power to
promote and help.</p>

<p>How are you? How is your wife? Are you ever talking about
me? against me? I am well in health, spite of the forcedly
sedentary life I lead. I think very often, under these radiant
skies, of the London fogs, and always regretfully. Individually
speaking, I was evidently intended for an Englishman.</p>

<p>What are you doing at Pinner? What little dogs have you
caused to disappear? How many poor hens kept in a state of
bondage, and tied by the leg somewhere, are awaiting for a
revolutionist to untie them?... What do you read? What do
you anticipate for England's politics? Do you smoke much?...
I wish we could have a talk of one hour all together, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
cigars and sherry, and then be back where I am wanted....

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mrs Peter Taylor</span> [March 19, 1857].</p>

<p>Thanks, my dear Friend, for your having remembered my
name's day [St Joseph's Day]. I don't know why, but every anniversary
concerning myself finds me very sad: those friendly
whisperings are checking the tendency.</p>

<p>The box has arrived. You have made out the <i>only</i> point of
contact between Shakespeare and myself, on all the rest we
deeply differ. He was an extraordinary poet: I am not. He
was&mdash;spite of your interpretations&mdash;calm:<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> I am not. He looked
on the world from above: I look at it from within and want to
make a revolution. He was&mdash;if reports are correct&mdash;merrily
poaching: I have always before my eyes, like a remorse, the
large convulsion with which a poor thrush, shot by me at the age
of sixteen, was twisting with her beak a bit of grass. He was the
Lord of Individuality: all my tendency, if developed, would have

<p class="left65">
[April 15, 1859.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;What can I say? You believe, as I do, in
God and immortality. It is there that you must find your
comfort and strength. Love your boy as if he were alive, for
in that you will have what will restore him to you in the series
of existences, which follows this one. Become even better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
you are by thinking of him, for this will make a bond of love
and mutual influence between you and him. Think of him when
you are doing good. Think of him, when impulses of selfishness
or human frailty assail you. Be good and strong. Give your
other children the love he gave them himself. And count on
God. There is immortality to link the mother and the child, and
only forgetfulness can break it. I have heard of his last words
and kisses: he loved you to his last moment, love him to yours,
and believe it, this will have been but the parting for a journey.</p>

<p>This is all I can say. From me to you such commonplace
words of comfort as the world generally gives would be a kind of
sin. I suffer with your grief. I, who have no home now, know
what the sorrows of home are,&mdash;they leave a scar in the heart,
which never goes, and that is sad, but it is well. Cherish this
scar, it is a pledge of the future. Do not give yourself up to
the barren, cowardly sorrow, called despair. There is no death
in the world except forgetfulness. Everything that loves and has
loved to death meets again. Good-bye, my friend. Think of
your health for the sake of your other children. God bless you
in them,&mdash;your friend,</p>

<p class="p2">[This letter was succeeded by the following.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have received your letters, they are more and
more sad. You have been ill and you are unhappy. Your visit
to the Continent will do you good physically, I hope, but as to
your moral health, you must cure that yourself. Rouse your soul,
which is in danger of being benumbed by sorrow; you will find
at the bottom of it, I don't say happiness, I don't say even hope,
but duty and faith in some affections which do count. For God's
sake, do not despair: you have dear children to bring up; you
can still do good, and you have friends who esteem and love you
and suffer with your sufferings and find strength in your own.
Ah me, what the devil should I do myself, if I allowed the little
strength, which God has left me, to desert me, as it often threatens
to do.... Good-bye. Yours with all my heart,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mr Peter Taylor</span> [September 11, 1860].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Peter</span>,&mdash;</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I have yours of the 29th of Aug. written with an improved
handwriting, and the article on Lady Byron. It is according to
me, unwise and unjust: unwise, because to praise Lady Byron for
her life's silence and to abuse the very man about whom she has
chosen to be silent, is inconsistent: unjust, because it grounds
a verdict on the wrongs of one party, without taking into
account those of the other. Everybody seems to forget that
Lady Byron did not only leave her husband for ever, going "à la
promenade," but that she did set at him before, lawyers and
doctors to try if she could make him be proved <i>mad</i>! I wish&mdash;no,
I don't&mdash;that your wife should set at you Dr E&mdash; and Mr
S&mdash; for such a purpose, only to see what you would do when
discovering it, and I wish I had time to write, before dying, a
book on Byron and abuse all England, a few women excepted,
for the way she treats one of her greatest souls and minds: I
shall never write the book nor&mdash;it begins to be clear&mdash;any other.</p>

<p>Well, I do not go into particulars about our condition here [at
Naples]. As a party we are going through that sort of method
which you called one day a <i>suicide</i>, preparing and attempting
things which are calling on us calumnies, abuse and persecution,
but which are taken up by the other Party as soon as we are put
out of the field. After having been baffled and most shamefully
so, in an attempt against the Pope's dominions,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they are now, at
a few days' distance, taking up our plan. We shall have to do
the same, soon or late, concerning Rome, and then Venice. And
we <i>shall</i>, if life endures. Only, I am worn out, morally and
physically.</p>

<p>Everything is now resting on Garibaldi: will he go on, without
<i>interruption</i>, in his invading career, or will he not? That is the
question. If he does, we shall have unity within five months:
Austria, spite of the boasted position, will not hold up, if the
proper means&mdash;a coup de main in the Tyrol, an insurrection in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
the Venetian mountainous districts, an attack by land, and a landing
near Trieste&mdash;are adopted. If he does not, we shall have
slumber, then anarchy&mdash;then&mdash;a little later&mdash;unity. <i>That</i> you
may consider as settled, and so far so good. The rest is all
wrong. And as for myself don't talk of either prosperity or consciousness
of having done, etc. All that is chaff. The only real
good thing would be to have unity atchieved [sic] quickly through
Garibaldi, and one year, before dying, of Walham Green or Eastbourne,
long silences, a few affectionate words to smooth the
ways, plenty of sea-gulls, and sad dozing.</p>

<p>Ah! if you had, in England, condescended to see that the
<i>glorious</i> declaration of non-interference ought to have begun by
taking away the French interference in Rome! How many
troubles and sacrifices you would have saved us!&mdash;ever your
truly affectionate and grateful</p>

<p class="left65">

<p class="p2">
[In another letter to Mr Taylor, dated June 5, 1860, he says:]
</p>

<p>Yes, I heard of Lady Byron's death and her last gift. I wish
something came out, now that she is dead, to explain the separation
mystery. I shall ever regret the burning of the memoirs,
which was a crime towards Byron; and I have ever indulged in
the dream that a copy should be extant in somebody's hands to
come out after the disappearing of the principal actors. I saw
Lady Byron twice, and she looked to me a good sharp positive
somewhat dry puritanical woman, sad from the past, conscious of
not having been altogether right and doing good half for good-doing's
sake, half for forgetfulness' sake. But I am so thoroughly
Byronian, so deeply convinced that he has been wronged by
everybody, that my impression cannot be trusted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mrs Peter Taylor</span> [February 9, 1865]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Clementia</span>,&mdash;</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I shall send back the magazine: read the article again: take
away all phrases and periphrases: <i>squeeze</i> every period; and
then send to me the first idea or view which strikes you as new
to yourself. I shall retract.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>

<p>The whole article amounts to this: repeating fifty times in
rather harmonious words that Art is the reproduction of Beauty,
etc., etc. Many thanks. Only, what is Beauty? How to discern
it? Why is Nature beautiful? Are we to copy, to reproduce
Nature? or to add a work of our own, finding out the idea shut
in within every symbol? Is Nature anything but the symbolic
representation of some truth, which we are to evolve? Or is the
drapery of Nature, Nature? Miss C&mdash;&mdash; says that the Artist
must choose the object which is Beautiful. Is not <i>every</i> object
more or less so? Is not the grotesque causing the beautiful to
shine by contrast? Are the grave-diggers to be suppressed in
Hamlet?</p>

<p>Without sifting the nature of Beauty, without giving some
definition of it, nobody can attempt to construct a Hierarchy
of Art. Miss C. has not even attempted to do so. Still you
have been in raptures. Something, therefore, must be in the
article. I have not been able to make it out. I beg pardon
humbly. That is all I can say.</p>

<p class="center p4">X</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Mr William Malleson</span> [Nov. 11, 1865].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I feel ashamed, but I have been overwhelmed
by work, not flourishing in health, although better now,
and altogether unable to fulfil what I had promised. Then, and
after all, I write to say that I cannot fulfil it. I said that I would
write about the education of your son. I find that I cannot. I
ought to know him, his tendencies, his capabilities, what he has
already learned. To give general rules is nothing. He <i>may</i>
require special ones.</p>

<p>I have mentioned his tendencies. <i>That</i> must be your special
object. Every man is a <i>speciality</i>, is capable of some definite
thing. You must try to discover that <i>special</i> tendency, and
then frame his education accordingly. After a general teaching
of those branches which are good for <i>any</i> man, direct his studies
towards the development of that special tendency which you will
have discovered. Education means <i>drawing out, educere</i>, what is
in the boy: not creating in him what is not. You cannot create.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>But one thing is, must be common to all. You must give him
a proper notion of what Life is, and of what the world in which
he has been put for the fulfilment of a task is.</p>

<p>Life is a duty, a function, a mission. For God's sake, do not
teach him any Benthamite theory about happiness either individual
or collective. A creed of <i>individual</i> happiness would make him
an egotist: a creed of collective happiness will reach the same
result soon or late. He will perhaps dream Utopias, fight for
them, whilst young; then, when he will find that he cannot realise
rapidly the dream of his soul, he will turn back to himself and
try to conquer <i>his</i> own happiness: sink into egotism.</p>

<p>Teach him that Life has no sense unless being a task:&mdash;that
happiness may, like sunshine on a traveller, come to him, and he
must welcome it and bless God for it; but that to <i>look</i> for it is
destroying both the moral man and his duty and most likely the
possibility of ever enjoying it:&mdash;that to improve himself, morally
and intellectually, for the sake of improving his fellow-creatures,
is his task:&mdash;that he must try to get at Truth and then represent
it, in words and deeds, fearlessly and perennially:&mdash;that to get
at Truth, two <i>criteria</i> have been given to him, his own conscience
and tradition, the conscience of mankind:&mdash;that whenever he
will find the inspiration of his own conscience harmonising with
that of mankind, sought for not in the history of a single period
or of a single people, but of all periods and peoples, then he is
sure of having Truth within his grasp:&mdash;that the basis of all
Truth is the knowledge of the Law of Life, which is indefinite
Progression:&mdash;that to this Law he must be a servant.</p>

<p>This knowledge of the Law of Progression must be your aim
in all your teaching.</p>

<p>Elementary Astronomy, elementary Geology, ought to be taught
as soon as possible. Then, universal History, then Languages.</p>

<p>The difficult thing is to get the proper teaching. When I
speak, for instance, of Astronomy, I mean a survey of the
Universe, of which the Earth is part, grounded on Herschel's
theory and tending to prove how everything is the exponent of
a Law of Progression, how the Law is one, how every part of
the Universe accomplishes a function in the whole. Herschel,
Nichol, Guillemin's recently translated "Heavens" are the guides
to be chosen.</p>

<p>Languages are easily learned in boyhood. French, German,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
and Italian ought to be taught. Two years of study may put
the boy in communication with three worlds.</p>

<p>I would not teach any <i>positive</i> Religion; but the great fundamental
Trinity, God, the immortality of the soul, the necessity
of a religion as a common link of brotherhood for mankind,
grounded on the acknowledgment of the Law of Progression.
At a later period he will choose.</p>

<p>Geography of course will be taught. But everything taught in
a <i>general</i> way and not applied is easily forgot. The best way is
to have a collection of good maps and to give him the habit of
never reading a historical book or even a tale without following
it up on the map. It is the best and most lasting way.</p>

<p>Avoid novels and tales. Give him a taste for historical books
and scientific descriptive <i>illustrated</i> books of natural history
travels, etc.</p>

<p>In one word, a religious conception of life&mdash;then a full notion
of the world he lives in&mdash;then the special branch of activity to
which he seems inclined: that is the whole of education for
your boy.</p>

<p>Forgive these hurried notes. Apply to me freely for any detail
or special suggestion. I shall be most happy to answer. Give
my love to Mrs Malleson and to Miss K. M. How are they?
How is your father? Where are you all now?&mdash;Ever affectionately
yours,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rest.</span></p>

<p>
[Written for the Pen and Pencil Club in April 1867, and
privately published in 1877, with other papers written by its
members.]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;The subject of your meeting of to-morrow is
so suggestive that I would gladly join you all, and write an essay on
it, if I had health and time. I have neither, and, perhaps, better so.
My essay, I candidly avow, would tend to prove that no essay
ought to be written on the subject. It has no reality. A sort of
intuitive instinct led you to couple "Ghosts and Rest" together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<p>There is, here down,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and there ought to be, no Rest. Life is
an <i>aim</i>; an aim which can be <i>approached</i>, not <i>reached</i>, here down.
There is, therefore, no rest. Rest is immoral.</p>

<p>It is not mine now to give a definition of the <i>aim</i>; whatever it
is, there is one, there <i>must</i> be one. Without it, Life has no sense.
It is atheistical; and moreover an irony and a deception.</p>

<p>I entertain all possible respect for the members of your Club;
but I venture to say that any contribution on Rest which will not
exhibit at the top a definition of Life will wander sadly between
wild arbitrary intellectual display and commonplaces.</p>

<p>Life is no sinecure, no "<i>recherche du bonheur</i>" to be secured, as
the promulgators of the theory had it, by guillotine, or, as their
less energetic followers have it, by railway shares, selfishness, or
contemplation. Life is, as Schiller said, "a battle and a march";
a battle for Good against Evil, for Justice against arbitrary privileges,
for Liberty against Oppression, for associated Love against
Individualism; a march onwards to Self, through collective Perfecting
to the progressive realisation of an Ideal, which is only
dawning to our mind and soul. Shall the battle be finally won
during life-time? Shall it on Earth? Are we believing in a
millennium? Don't we feel that the spiral curve through which
we ascend had its beginning elsewhere, and has its end, if any,
beyond this terrestrial world of ours. Where is then a possible
foundation for your essays and sketches?</p>

<p>Goethe's "Contemplation" has created a multitude of little
sects aiming at Rest, where is no rest, falsifying art, the element
of which is evolution, not reproduction, transformation, not contemplation,
and enervating the soul in self-abdicating Brahmanic
attempts. For God's sake let not your Club add one little sect to
the fatally existing hundreds!</p>

<p>There is nothing to be looked for in life except the uninterrupted
fulfilment of Duty, and, not Rest, but consolation and strengthening
from Love. There is, not Rest, but a promise, a shadowing
forth of Rest in Love. Only there must be in Love absolute
<i>trust</i>; and it is very seldom that this blessing depends [? descends]
on us. The child goes to sleep, a dreamless sleep, with unbounded
<i>trust</i>, on the mother's bosom; but <i>our</i> sleep is a restless one,
agitated by sad dreams and alarms.</p>

<p>You will smile at my lugubrious turn of mind; but if I was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
of <i>your</i> Artists, I would sketch a man on the scaffold going to die
for a great Idea, for the cause of Truth, with his eye looking trustfully
on a loving woman, whose finger would trustfully and
smilingly point out to him the unbounded. Under the sketch I
would write, not Rest, but "a Promise of Rest." Addio: tell me
one word about the point of view of your contributors.&mdash;Ever
affectionately yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Clementia</span>,&mdash;</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I am better, although not so much as my friends here
suppose. I feel, from various little symptoms, as if I could any
week have the complaint back. I may, and hope to be mistaken,
however. So, let us accept what instalment is granted, and not
think of the future. I might give myself an additional chance, if
I could keep absolutely silent and motionless during one month.
But I cannot. There is&mdash;at least&mdash;a possibility of the Republic
being proclaimed in Spain; and if so, we must try to follow, a
preparatory very complex work is therefore unavoidable. It is
useless to tell me: "if you keep quiet now, you will be able to
work better henceforward." The important thing is to work now.</p>

<p>Your cabinet<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> is a shameful contrivance.... It is an implement
good for the conquest of the Irish measure, and soon after,
I think, the majority will split into two or three fractions. As to
your&mdash;quite forgotten&mdash;international life, the main thing about
which, according to me, you ought to care, Lord Clarendon's
policy will be a French and Austrian policy. What does Peter
say? Is he still enthusiastic about Gladstone?</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Your women-emancipating movement is fairly imitated in
Italy. We have a central committee of ladies in Naples, and
sub-committees here and there, and one or two members of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
House pleading for them. All this is very right, and I hope that
next year, European events will help this movement; but meanwhile,
I should wish very much that, whilst you attack men with
their gross injustice, you should teach women to <i>deserve</i> their
emancipation: nothing is conquered unless <i>deserved</i>. The poor
working men <i>have</i> deserved; they have for one century fought,
bled, acted for <i>all</i> the good causes in Europe: the majority of
your women still fight almost entirely for a husband to be won by
their personal genuine or artificial appearance; they worship
<i>fashion</i> more than the Ideal. You ought to write one tract to men
and one to them.</p>

been forgotten: none is of those whom I loved in England. For

"fata viam invenient."</p>

<p>I know that you have been and are very active in the "Woman's

you ready to help; and I had no doubt of your coming forward in
one which ought to be a matter of simple duty for anyone believing
that there is but one God&mdash;one Life&mdash;one Law of progress
through Love, Equality and Association for it. Still, it is
comforting to hear of it. The movement has begun and with
some degree of power in Italy too: it would rapidly and successfully

libri</i>, 77, 119, and <i>Vita di G. Mazzini</i>, 29 n., 431, and Canestrelli's
bibliography, pp. 290, 291, 305, 308-9, 311.]</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Translations.</span></p>

<p>The greater portion of the first seven volumes of the <i>Scritti
editi e inediti</i>, with some additional matter, was translated into
English as <i>Life and Writings of Joseph Mazzini</i>, 6 vols. (London,
1870). The <i>Duties of Man</i> and <i>Democracy in Europe</i> (<i>alias The
Systems and the Democracy</i>, the early chapters of which were
written originally in English) have been translated by Madame
Venturi and were published by H. S. King in 1877 and later by
Alexander and Shepherd. <span class="smcap">From the Pope to the Council</span> (<i>alias
Letter to the Oecumenical Council</i>) and <i>Lamennais</i> have been
translated by Mme. Venturi. <i>Faith and the Future</i> and other
essays have been translated by Mr T. Okey and published
by Dent. Together with <i>From the Council to God</i>, <i>The Duties of
Man</i>, and <i>To the Italian Working-man</i>, they have been published
by Dent in "Everyman's Library." Various extracts have been
collected by the Bishop of Truro and published by Fisher Unwin.
There is a volume of translations in the Camelot Classics. Several
earlier translations of separate essays have been published.</p>

<p>There are two volumes of a German translation, published by
Hoffmann u. Campe (Hamburg, 1868). <i>The Duties of Man</i> and
<i>Democracy in Europe</i> are published in French by Charpentier
(Paris, 1881).</p>

<p>The following collections have been published:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Giuseppe Mazzini e i fratelli Ruffini</i>, by C. Cagnacci (Porto
Maurizio, 1893). Contains his letters to Madame Ruffini (1837-1841),
a few letters to A. and G. Ruffini, and extracts from his
letters to Elia Benza.</p>

(Paris, 1895). Contains letters to L. A. Melegari and Madame
de Mandrot (mostly 1836-1843).</p>

<p><i>La Giovine Italia e la giovine Europa</i> (Milan, 1906). Contains
letters to L. A. Melegari (chiefly 1833).</p>

<p><i>Lettere inedite di Giuseppe Mazzini, pubblicate da L. Ordoño de
Rosales</i> (Turin, 1898). Contains letters to Gaspare de Rosales
(mostly 1834-1836).</p>

(Paris, 1873) (letters of 1864-1872).</p>

<p><i>Corrispondenza inedita di Giuseppe Mazzini con ...</i> (Milan,
1872). [This is the correspondence in 1863-1864 with Signor
Diamilla-Müller, who was the intermediary between Mazzini and
Victor Emmanuel. It has been republished in <i>Politica segreta
italiana</i> (Turin, 1880).]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span></p>

<p>A very imperfect collection of Mazzini's correspondence is now
being published under the editorship of Signor Ernesto Nathan,
as <i>Epistolario di Giuseppe Mazzini</i> (Florence, 1902). Two volumes
only have as yet appeared; their most important feature is Mazzini's
correspondence with his mother.</p>

<p>Many letters are also published in the introductions to Mazzini's
<i>Scritti editi e inediti</i> and in Madame Mario's <i>Della Vito di G.
Mazzini</i> and <i>Scritti scelti</i>; also in Linaker, <i>La vita e i tempi di E.
Mayer</i> (Florence, 1898) [letters to E. Mayer]; <i>Nuova Antologia</i>,
Dec. 1, 1884 [letters to Madame Magiotti and E. Mayer]; <i>Ib.</i>, May
1 and 16, 1890 [letters to F. Le Monnier]; <i>Ib.</i>, May 1, 1907; Del

<i>&OElig;uvres completes</i>, xi. 32, 423; Luzio, <i>G. Mazzini</i> (Milan, 1905);

<p>I have also been able to see some 350 unpublished letters,&mdash;to
Mr and Mrs Peter Taylor (of the greatest value for Mazzini's
public and private life); Mr William Shaen (a large and important
collection); Mrs Milner-Gibson; Mr W. Malleson; Mr W.
E. Hickson (when editor of the <i>Westminster Review</i>); Mr Peter
Stuart; and Miss Galeer.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Biographies.</span></p>

<p>Mazzini's autobiographical notes in the earlier volumes of the
<i>Scritti editi e inediti</i> are of course of the highest value. The completest
life is Mario, <i>Della vita di Giuseppe Mazzini</i> (Milan, 1886),
containing a mass of valuable material, but partial and including
much extraneous matter. There is a much better study of
Mazzini's early life, prefixed to the same authoress' <i>Scritti scelti</i>.
Saffi's introductions to several volumes of the <i>Scritti editie e inediti</i>
are most valuable. Donaver's <i>Vita di G. Mazzini</i> is useful,
especially for the earlier period. There is a short memoir by
Madame Venturi (<i>née</i> Miss Ashurst) prefixed to the English translation
of the Duties of Man. I have seen no other biographies of
any value.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Notices and Studies.</span></p>

<p>There is a life-like portrait of Mazzini and much information
about his early life in G. Ruffini, <i>Lorenzo Benoni</i> (Edinburgh,
1853); a valuable sketch, largely based on conversations with
Madame Mazzini, by Mr William Shaen in <i>The Public Good</i>,
1851; and some useful information in Donaver, <i>Uomini e libri</i>.
There are studies of more or less value in Cantimori, <i>Saggio
sull'idealismo di G. Mazzini</i> (Faenza, 1904); Linaker, <i>La Vita
italiana nel risorgimento</i> (Florence, 1899); Nencioni, <i>Saggi critici
di letteratura italiana</i> (Florence, 1898); Oxilia, <i>Giuseppe Mazzini,
uomo e letterato</i> (Florence, 1902); F. Myers in <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
1878; De Sanctis, <i>La letteratura italiana nel secola XIX.</i> (Naples,
1902); D'Ancona e Bacci, <i>Manuale della lettaratura italiana</i>, vol. v.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
(Florence, 1901); <i>Mazzini: Conferenze tenute in Genova</i> (Genova,
1906). There are valuable analyses of Mazzini's economic position
in Bozzino, <i>Il socialismo e la dottrina sociale di Mazzini</i> (Genoa,
1895), and Bertacchi, <i>Il pensiero sociale di Giuseppe Mazzini</i>
(Milan, 1900). Hostile studies in Bianchi, <i>Vicende del Mazzinianismo</i>
(Savona, 1854) and Grüber, <i>Massoneria e Rivoluzione</i>
(Rome, 1901), the latter of small value.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> So Madame Mario, who probably had it from Mazzini's mother, and
Madame Venturi on the authority of a college friend. The memoir by
another fellow-student in <i>Epistolario di G. Mazzini</i>, I. xxix. says that he
thought that a doctor was not free to express his opinions for fear of
offending his patients, and that he therefore never studied medicine; so
too Donaver, <i>Uomini e libri</i>, 70. But see his <i>Vita di G. Mazzini</i>, 13, on
apparently good evidence.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> He seems never to have learnt to read German easily; at all events
he could not do so till comparatively late in life.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> See pp. <a href="#Page_325">325</a>-<a href="#Page_327">327</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This description was given to, and published by Mr W. Shaen.
There is reason for thinking it was written by Enrico Mayer, the Tuscan
educationalist.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> For Gallenga's plot to assassinate the King, see below, c. ix.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Her niece, Mademoiselle Dora Melegari, tells me that her aunt's real
name was not Madeleine, as given in the <i>Lettres Intimes</i>; what it was,
Mademoiselle Melegari does not at present feel justified in disclosing.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> For once his knowledge of Dante seems to have failed him. Many
years after he quotes the expression to "Daniel Stern," but owns that he
cannot refer to the verse.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> He subsequently discovered that it was a loan, and insisted on repaying
it shortly before his death.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The only evidence for this is contained in Cagnacci, <i>Giuseppe Mazzini
e i fratelli Ruffini</i>, pp. 287, 290, from which it seems probable that
Mazzini saw Madame Ruffini between June and November, 1844, and
therefore, almost certainly, was at Genoa. Signor Donaver thinks it
doubtful whether <i>la Cugina</i> of the Ruffinis' letters refers to Mazzini, but
the internal evidence seems to me to favour the identification. Signor
Cagnacci's note on p. 290 seems to imply that he has seen a memorandum
by Elia Benza to the effect that Benza saw him at Porto Maurizio about
this time disguised as a Capucin.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Carlyle's statement (<i>Reminiscences</i>, ii. 182) that he "once or twice"
talked with Mazzini is rather startlingly inaccurate. See Carlyle's <i>Life in
London</i>, i. 488.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> There are some interesting descriptions of the Carlyles in Giovanni
Ruffini's letters to his mother. See Cagnacci, <i>op. cit.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Madame Mario says in her <i>Della vita di Mazzini</i>, in the middle of
1838; but I think it is quite clear from <i>Lettres intimes</i>, 197 and 205;
Giurati, <i>op. cit.</i>, 11-12; Cagnacci, <i>op. cit.</i>, 447 that 1839 is the true date.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> See below, p. <a href="#Page_127">127</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> According to Madame Venturi (English Edition of Mazzini, V. 96)
the King offered him the premiership; but neither Mazzini himself, nor,
so far as I know, any of the memoirs of the time mention it. For other
overtures from the government see Donaver in <i>Rassegna Nazionale</i>,
Dec. 1, 1898.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> See below, c. xvii.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> I owe these particulars to one who knew him well, and to a
contemporary description in a private letter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> It has often been supposed that Browning had Mazzini in mind, when
he wrote <i>The Italian in England</i>. I know of no evidence for or against
this; but the poem was written in 1845, when the letter-opening affair
had made Mazzini prominently public. Mazzini is said to have made a
translation of it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> See below, pp. <a href="#Page_359">359</a>-<a href="#Page_360">360</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Walter Savage Landor wrote to one of Mazzini's friends, promising
£95 for the family "of the first patriot, who asserts the dignity and
fulfils the duty of tyrannicide."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> <i>Alias</i> Luigi Mariotti, writer of Italian grammar books for English
schools.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> For some of the evidence on these cases, I may refer to my <i>History
of Italian Unity</i>, II. 385-387. See also Uccellini, <i>Memorie</i>, 209-210;
Mazzini, <i>Lettere ad A. Giannelli</i>, 301, 437. Signor Dagnino tells me
from his personal knowledge that in 1864 Mazzini stopped a plot to
blow up the Austrian Viceroy of Venetia.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Mazzini's and Kossuth's letters on the subject are in the <i>Daily News</i>
of February 19, March 2 and 4, 1853. See also Mazzini, <i>Scritti</i>, VIII.
283-4. He seems to have made a disingenuous use of another proclamation
by Kossuth later in the year: see Bianchi, <i>Vicende del Mazzinianismo</i>,
85. I hardly think that Mr Stillman's statement in his <i>Union of Italy</i>,
p. 275, can stand against Kossuth's plain statement in the <i>Daily News</i>.
Mr Stillman too is wrong as to Mazzini's share in the rising. I am
inclined on the whole to think that he was justified in using Agostino's
name; see <i>Daily News</i>, February 17 and 20, 1853.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Mr W. R. Thayer has kindly ascertained for me that there is absolutely
nothing in Sanders' correspondence in the U.S.A. Bureau of Rolls,
that relates either to Mazzini or Kossuth; but Saffi, who tells the story of
the dinner, was present at it himself. See Mazzini, <i>Scritti</i>, IX. xciv, 60.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The following letter from Garibaldi has, I believe, not been published:
I have translated it.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<span class="smcap i10">Caprera</span>, <i>March 27, '60</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap">Dear Mazzini</span>,&mdash;I am thinking of leaving for Genoa on April 1, from
there I shall go to Nice, where I am summoned by my fellow-citizens,
who are afraid of falling into the wolf's mouth. I enclose two lines for
McAdam [Mr John McAdam of Glasgow]. If you come, let me know.&mdash;Your
brother, <span class="smcap">Giuseppe</span>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Mr Adam of Glasgow will send Mr William Ashurst a sum
for the Million Rifles Fund; please spend it in the purchase of the rifles
in question.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Garibaldi.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Rival funds for Mazzini and Garibaldi were collected in England and
there was some strong feeling between their respective backers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> According to a letter from Mazzini to Brofferio, published in <i>Roma e
Venezia</i>, January 15, 1861, (the full text of which I have not seen), the
King seems to have asked for an interview with him, and he had "no
shadow of difficulty in principle" to it.</p>

Wolff of the journey to Sicily. See <i>Lettere ad A. Giannelli</i>, 503.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> <i>Conscienza</i>; in Mazzini's use of the word, it covers both 'consciousness'
and 'conscience.' Mazzini himself translated it by 'conscience' (see
below, p. <a href="#Page_362">362</a>), where 'consciousness' would be more accurate.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> In the undated letter, quoted by Signor Donaver in the <i>Rassegna
Nazionale</i>, Oct. 1, 1890, he speaks of a reformed Catholic church becoming
"the guide of the State and not its servant"; but I think he says
rather more than he really felt in order to conciliate an old clerical
friend, to whom the letter seems to be addressed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Mr Peter Taylor in the Newcastle election, 1859.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> See below, pp. <a href="#Page_292">292</a>-<a href="#Page_294">294</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> In the letter referred to on p. <a href="#Footnote_37">246 note</a>, he calls it "religious education,"
but it is clear that he did not intend the expression in its usual
sense.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Mazzini's views are perhaps most clearly stated in his speech to the
Roman Assembly of March 9, 1849 (before he became Triumvir). See
also <i>Scritti editi e inediti</i>, XVI. 14. In the second and perhaps the first
of these passages <i>popolo</i> seems used as equivalent to parliament. In the
second, <i>governo</i> is obviously not the executive. See also above, p. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> He was once arguing with Sir James Stansfeld as to the possibility of
communism. Stansfeld said, "Why should not all property be vested in
society?" Mazzini replied, "Because that is nonsense. Society abstractedly
is nothing, really a collection of individuals. Individuals do
the work, therefore individuals get the property; they may give it away
if they like, but the right to it is in themselves." The spirit of the argument
is curiously inconsistent with his usual position.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The first address of the People's International League, from which
these words are quoted, was written by W. J. Linton, but was based on
